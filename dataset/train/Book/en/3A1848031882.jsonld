            "abstract": "\"In a fast-moving globalized world, companies need to develop contingent plans. This book, by analyzing the practical aspects of creating and using intangible resources for international development, offers original and relevant insights on this subject. The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical and practical aspects of using and developing the intangible resources when a firm expands its international business operations. The book also sheds light into the understanding of various dimensions of intangible resources and their impacts on the efficiency and sustainability of firms. To investigate these issues, the book addresses topics, which have usually either not been given enough attention, hence not sufficiently investigated or not yet researched at all. It refers to a broad variety of issues including theoretical and empirical aspects of the role of intangible assets in firm internationalization. These include the reticular resources implemented by international management, methods of mobilizing cultural resources internationally, as well as specifics of small and medium-sized enterprises in various country contexts, particularly in emerging economies. Firm Internationalization: Mobilization of Intangible Resources will be valuable reading for scholars, researchers and academics in the fields of international business and strategic management in particular.\"",
