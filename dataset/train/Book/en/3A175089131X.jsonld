            "abstract": "\"This new handbook on radar signal analysis adopted a deliberate and systematic approach. It uses a clear and consistent level of delivery while maintaining strong and easy to follow mathematical details. The emphasis of this book is on radar signal types and their relevant signal processing and not on radar systems hardware or components. This handbook serves as a valuable reference to a wide range of audience. More specifically, college level students, practicing radar engineers, as well as casual readers of the subject are the intended target audience of the first few chapters of this book. As the book chapters progress, these grow in complexity and specificity. Accordingly, later chapters are intended for practicing engineers, graduate college students, and advanced readers. Finally, the last few chapters contain several special topics on radar systems that are both educational and scientifically entertaining to all readers. The presentation of topics in this handbook takes the reader on a scientific journey whose major landmarks comprise the different radar sub-systems and components. In this context, the chapters of this book follow the radar signal along this journey from its birth to the end of its life. Along the way, the different relevant radar subsystems are analyzed and discussed in great level of details. The chapter-contributors of this new handbook comprise well-seasoned academia members and practicing radar engineers. Their combined years of academic and real-world experiences are well in excess of 175 years. They together bring a unique easy to follow mix of mathematical and practical presentations of the topics discussed in this book. See \"Chapter Contributors\" section of this book to learn more about these individuals\"--",
