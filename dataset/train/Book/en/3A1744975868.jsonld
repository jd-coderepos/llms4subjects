                "The analysis of corporate governance in small and medium-sized firms has been a much-neglected aspect of study in the field of corporate governance. This essential research review provides an authoritative overview of research in this topical field by successfully linking classical papers on corporate governance to the specific aspects in SMEs. The purpose of this book is not only to provide a review of the literature on governance in SMEs, but also from other social sciences and management perspectives. This title will be of great interest not only to lecturers and students interested in corporate governance but also to managers and policy makers",
