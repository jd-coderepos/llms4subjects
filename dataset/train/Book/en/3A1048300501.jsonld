            "abstract": "This handbook provides a glimpse of the research that is underway in smart cities, with an examination of the relevant issues. It describes software infrastructures for smart cities, the role of 5G and Internet of things in future smart cities scenarios, the use of clouds and sensor-based devices for monitoring and managing smart city facilities, a variety of issues in the emerging field of urban informatics, and various smart city applications. Handbook of Smart Cities includes fifteen chapters from renowned worldwide researchers working on various aspects of smart city scale cyber-physical systems. It is intended for researchers, developers of smart city technologies and advanced-level students in the fields of communication systems, computer science, and data science. This handbook is also designed for anyone wishing to find out more about the on-going research thrusts and deployment experiences in smart cities. It is meant to provide a snapshot of the state-of-the-art at the time of its writing in several software services and cyber infrastructures as pertinent to smart cities. This handbook presents application case studies in video surveillance, smart parking, and smart building management in the smart city context. Unique experiences in designing and implementing the applications or the issues involved in developing smart city level applications are described in these chapters. Integration of machine learning into several smart city application scenarios is also examined in some chapters of this handbook",
