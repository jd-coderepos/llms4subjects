                "A goal of this study was the systematic identification of biomechanical stress acting on the occupants in regard of the cervical spine with the newly defined sandwichcollision. This describes a rear-end collision of a vehicle with a second vehicle in front of it, which is pushed onto a third vehicle, which is in front of the second vehicle, in turn. The second vehicle's, thus the middle of the three vehicles, occupants' movement was of interest and was calculated on the basis of 36 simulations and compared to 34 simulated head-on collisions. The simulation calculations using PC-Crash and Madymo showed that, while at the same collision-related velocity change, the vehicle involved in a sandwichcollision induces a significantly higher biomechanical stress to which the vehicle occupant was exposed than a head-on collision considered in isolation. This occurred at a gap of 80 cm and less between the front and the middle vehicle. These gaps are typically exceeded, but can fall short of in hazardous situations too. For the quantification of the biomechanical stress the differential speed between head and torso during the deceleration phase after the rear-end collision at the head-on collision was evaluated. By this differential speed shearing motions between head and torso can be explained. As a result the so defined biomechanical frontal stress in the event of a sandwichcollision by the overlap of the rebound-movement of the rear-end collision with the head-on collision exceeds ...",
