                "The history of Mathematics has been lead in part by the desire for generalization: once an object was given and had been understood, there was the desire to find a more general version of it, to fit it into a broader framework. Noncommutative Mathematics fits into this description, as its interests are objects analoguous to vector spaces, or probability spaces, etc., but without the commonsense interpretation that those latter objects possess. Indeed, a space can be described by its points, but also and equivalently, by the set of functions on this space. This set is actually a commutative algebra, sometimes equipped with some more structure: *-algebra, C*-algebra, von Neumann algebras, Hopf algebras, etc. The idea that lies at the basis of noncommutative Mathematics is to replace such algebras by algebras that are not necessarily commutative any more and to interpret them as \"algebras of functions on noncommutative spaces\". Of course, these spaces do not exist independently from their defining algebras, but facts show that a lot of the results holding in (classical) probability or (classical) group theory can be extended to their noncommutative counterparts, or find therein powerful analogues. The extensions of group theory into the realm of noncommutative Mathematics has long been studied and has yielded the various quantum groups. The easiest version of them, the compact quantum groups, consist of C*-algebras equipped with a *-homomorphism &Delta with values in the tensor ...",
