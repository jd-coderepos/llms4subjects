            "abstract": "\"The original Companion to Linguistic Anthropology was published in 2004. The New Companion, whose all-new chapters aim to capture the state of the discipline in the first two decades of the twenty-first century, illustrates the many exciting new directions in linguistic anthropology as well as the persistence, elaboration, and transformation of some of the foundational concepts discussed in the 2004 volume. The major sections in the new volume showcase how the subfield has reworked classic linguistic anthropological concepts and methods and developed new ones in response to political, social, and technological developments over the last several decades, including 1) renewing commitments to engaged linguistic anthropology in a time of ongoing political and environmental crises 2) continuing to both critique and assert the relevance of community and its multiple variants as a unit of analysis 3) tracing the temporal and spatial contours of interaction in a globalized, mediatized world and 4) emphasizing the role of the senses and experience in language. In the introduction, we explore each of these developments in turn, revealing ways they influence each other and how they have shaped thematic developments in the field, including the rise to prominence of topics such as chronotope and scale, materiality, language and experience, decolonization, and posthumanism. The discussion focuses on the ways in which: 1. linguistic anthropologists have recommitted themselves to social justice issues and responded directly to political and historical events and crises of the first two decades of the 21st century 2. the resulting new thematic directions in linguistic anthropology have both transformed and reaffirmed the field&apos;s classic topics of study, methods, and theoretical underpinnings 3. such developments enable new forms of interdisciplinarity both within and beyond anthropology and allow us to (re)consider both the place of language and the taken-for-granted centrality of humans in our research\"--",
