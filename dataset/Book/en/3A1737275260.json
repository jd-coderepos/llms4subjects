            "abstract": "\"This book, on the basis of a generalization and critical analysis of materials on constructed concrete dams, accumulated experience in their operation, and current trends, considers a set of problems associated with the design and construction of concrete dams. The modern principles of designing gravity and arch dams and the main provisions of the calculation justification of their reliability in comparison with US standards are outlined. Great attention has been paid to rolled concrete dams, taking into account their specific characteristics. Ways of increasing the efficiency of dams through the improvement of layout and structural solutions, calculation methods, and a more complete consideration of the features of natural conditions are considered. The book presents and analyzes the designs of erected concrete dams, which allows for a better understanding of the approaches and decision-making principles for designing dams, taking into account the specifics of natural, construction and other conditions, and also analyzes a number of new solutions that reflect the various ways that engineering theory and practice has sought further improvement of concrete dams. This work will be useful to hydraulic engineers and professionals involved in the design, construction and operation of concrete dams, as well as in settlement studies; the book can also be used by academics and as a textbook by university students specializing in hydraulic engineering\"--",
