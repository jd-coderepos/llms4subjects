                "Getting started with electronic circuits -- All about Raspberry Pi -- Starting with the basics: programming with scratch -- Using Python for input and output: GPIO zero -- More input and output: infrared sensors and LCD displays -- Adding control in Python and Linux -- Creating video with a Pi camera -- Rolling forward: designing and building a robot -- Customize your gameplay: Minecraft hardware programming -- Making your circuits permanent -- Let the innovation begin: designing your own circuits",
                "Learning electronics can be tremendous fun -- your first flashing LED circuit is a reason to celebrate! But where do you go from there, and how can you move into more challenging projects without spending a lot of money on proprietary kits? One excellent answer is Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is everywhere, it&apos;s inexpensive, and it&apos;s a wonderful tool for teaching about electronics and programming. Learn Electronics with Raspberry Pi shows you how to make a variety of cool projects using the Pi with programming languages like Scratch and Python, with no experience necessary. You&apos;ll learn how the Pi works, how to work with Raspbian Linux on the Pi, and how to design and create electronic circuits. You&apos;ll then create projects like an arcade game, disco lights, and infrared transmitter, and an LCD display. You&apos;ll also learn how to control Minecraft&apos;s Steve with a joystick and how to build a Minecraft house with a Pi, and even how to control a LEGO train with a Pi. You&apos;ll even learn how to create your own robot, including how to solder and even design a printed circuit board! Learn how to design and build electronic circuits, and even how to make a PCB Learn how to make fun projects like an arcade game, a robot, and a Minecraft controller while learning about sensors and how devices talk to each other Get started programming the Pi with Scratch and Python"
