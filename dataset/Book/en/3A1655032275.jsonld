                "This book is intended for &amp;tudents, research engineers, and mathematicians interested in applications or numerical analysis. Pure analysts will also find some new problems to tackle. Most of the material can be understood by a reader with a relatively modest knowledge of differential and inte­ gral equations and functional analysis. Readers interested in stochastic optimization will find a new theory of prac­ tical . importance. Readers interested in problems of static and quasi-static electrodynamics, wave scattering by small bodies of arbitrary shape, and corresponding applications in geophysics, optics, and radiophysics will find explicit analytical formulas for the scattering matrix, polarizability tensor, electrical capacitance of bodies of an arbitrary shape; numerical examples showing the practical utility of these formulas; two-sided variational estimates for the pol­ arizability tensor; and some open problems such as working out a standard program for calculating the capacitance and polarizability of bodies of arbitrary shape and numerical calculation of multiple integrals with weak singularities. Readers interested in nonlinear vibration theory will find a new method for qualitative study of stationary regimes in the general one-loop passive nonlinear network, including stabil­ ity in the large, convergence, and an iterative process for calculation the stationary regime. No assumptions concerning the smallness of the nonlinearity or the filter property of the linear one-port are made. New results in the theory of nonlinear operator equations form the basis for the study."
