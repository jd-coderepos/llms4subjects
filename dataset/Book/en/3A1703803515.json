                "This book provides up-to-date information on biochar use in management of soil health, agriculture productivity, green-house gases, restoration ecology and environment. Biochar application to nutrient deficient and disturbed soils is a viable option which may promotes advances in food safety and food security to human nutrition and overall fundamental research in the agricultural sciences. The book describes in detail how the recalcitrant biochar is able to persist for long periods of time and work as a shelter for soil microbial colonisation and their biomass/numbers. This book also includes contents related to important role of biochar applications in the restoration of contaminated agricultural soils. The book will be of particular interest to students, teachers and researchers in the disciplines.",
