                "\"So is described one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century, yet someone who was barely known beyond mathematical corridors till the revelations in the 1970s. It was then that Alan Turing&apos;s critical contributions to the breaking of the German Enigma code, along with the circumstances of his suicide at the height of his powers, became widely known. From the rather odd, precocious, gauche boy through an adolescence in which his mathematical ability began to blossom, to the achievements of his maturity, the story of Turing&apos;s life fascinates. In the years since his suicide, Turing&apos;s reputation has only grown, as his contributions to logic, mathematics, computing, artificial intelligence and computational biology have become better appreciated. To commemorate the centenary of Turing&apos;s birth, this republication of his mother&apos;s biography, unavailable for many years, is enriched by a new foreword by Martin Davis and a never-before published memoir by Alan&apos;s older brother, which sheds new light on Alan&apos;s relationship with his family, and on the man himself\"--",
