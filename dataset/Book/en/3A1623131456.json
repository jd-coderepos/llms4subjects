This revision has been fully updated based on classroom experience. Including a completely new chapter providing an elementary introduction to thermodynamics, kinetics, radioactive decay and absolute dating, this new edition also features new mineral descriptions and many new stunning color photographs. A new section on hydraulic fracturing and discussion of some of its most serious potential environmental consequences has also been added.
