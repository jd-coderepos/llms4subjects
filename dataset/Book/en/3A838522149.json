            "abstract": "The languages of light: a creative approach to residential lighting is both a beautiful and informative introduction to understanding light and its qualities, as these inform residential buildings, garden lighting and outdoor rooms . The book is organised through clearly defined chapters such as Understanding Light, Daylight, Colour, Surface and Texture, Lighting Techniques and Tools and Case Studies . The Languages Of Light addresses basic questions from What is light? to How light effects our emotions and our physical response to light? and explains how these inform lighting design in residential contexts across both the professional and layperson s approach. The book is lavishly illustrated with specially commissioned photography informing the numerous case studies that make explicit The Purpose of Garden Lighting, Lighting Effects, Decorative Lighting, and The Use of Holograms and Lasers . Easy to follow examples of kitchen, bathroom, study and garden ensembles further elucidate the subject for the reader. Written by leading lighting designers, Rebecca Weir and Allyson Coates, The Languages of Light is directed at a broad readership comprising interior designers, decorators, architects and anyone with an interest in contemporary architecture and design.\"",
