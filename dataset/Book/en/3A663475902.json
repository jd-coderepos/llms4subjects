Explaining solid state physics in a clear and detailed way, it also has over 50 exercises for students to test their knowledge. In addition to the extensive discussion of magnetic impurity problems, bosonization, quantum phase transitions, and disordered systems from the first edition, the new edition includes such topics as topological insulators, high-temperature superconductivity and Mott insulators, renormalization group for Fermi liquids, spontaneous symmetry breaking, zero and finite-temperature Green functions, and the Kubo formalism\"--",
