            "abstract": "This product is not available separately, it is only sold as part of a set. There are 750 products in the set and these are all sold as one entity, New techniques, improved understanding and changes in regulations relating to environmental analysis means that students, technicians and lecturers alike need an up-to-date guide to practical environmental analysis. This unique book provides detailed instructions for practical experiments in environmental analysis. The comprehensive coverage includes the chemical analysis of important pollutants in air, water, soil and plant tissue, and the experiments generally require only basic laboratory equipment and instrumentation. The content is supported by theoretical material explaining, amongst other concepts, the principles behind each method and the importance of various pollutants. Also included are suggestions for projects and worked examples. Appendices cover environmental standards, practical safety and laboratory practice. Building on the foundations laid by the highly acclaimed first edition, this new edition has been revised and updated to include information on new monitoring techniques, the Air Quality Index, internet resources and professional ethics.  Like its predecessor, this informative text is certain to be valued as an indispensable guide to practical environmental analysis by students on a variety of science courses and their lecturers. Reviews of the first edition: \"I strongly urge academics in chemistry, biology, botany, soil science, geography and environmental science departments to give [this book] serious consideration as a course text.\" Malcolm Cresser, Environment Department, University of York, UK \"Destined to become a course text for many university courses i?? a high quality, informative introductory text i?? there should be multiple copies on most university&apos;s library shelves.\" Environmental Conservation",
