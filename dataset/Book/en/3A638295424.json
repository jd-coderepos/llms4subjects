This second edition features new sections on simulation of continuous systems, the Chirp-z transform, linear and logarithmic sampling and resampling, the discrete sine transform, spread-spectrum techniques, digital differentiation, and integration. It also includes more information on the power density spectrum, implementation of the FFT, and the equation error method in adaptive signal processing\"--",

The purpose of this second edition, its intended audience, and our reasons for writing it are still the same as those described in the first preface. In this second edition we have attempted to correct and improve the original text in response to comments from colleagues, students, and other friends who have suggested ways to clarify and improve the book. We have also added topics that have become the basis for current DSP applications of which we are aware, as well as several topics which, we have been informed repeatedly, \"should have been included\" in the first edition. These include a chapter on modeling analog systems and a chapter on pattern recognition (as used in discrimination, detection, and decision making) using support vector machines, as well as sections on the chirp-z transform, resampling and waveform reconstruction, the discrete sine transform, logarithmic and nonuniform sampling, and other items, including an appendix containing a table of transforms more comprehensive than the table in the first edition\"--"
