            "abstract": "\"Water is the most vital matter for every aspect of life, and its contamination due to humankind&apos;s activities poses a grand global challenge. Its remediation is the need of the times for drinking purposes and environmental protection. Many research groups worldwide have been working for thriving remediation technologies based on nanomaterials in the recent two decades. Water and wastewater treatment by nanomaterial-based technologies has become a beneficial aid in finding possible solutions for contaminated wastewater released from various water sources. Nanoscale materials are seen to take on unique and unpredictable properties that make them more robust, flexible, lighter, and faster, and the specific material used for the formation of devices and systems. Features: This book presents the use of different advanced nanomaterials to remediate water and wastewater. The uses of carbon-based nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and biopolymer-supported nanomaterials for water remediation have been explored, accentuating new-generation materials. Water purification methods like disinfection of water using green synthesized nanomaterials, adsorption through nanomaterial-based adsorbents, and nanofiltration techniques have been discussed. We have emphasized efficient water treatment methods and exploiting new emerging nanomaterials on the toxicological study of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials provide high-performance and cost-effective treatment for water remediation. Various nanomaterials and electrochemical methods are used to relent, remove, or neutralize water harmful organic and inorganic contaminants of water through adsorption, filtration, and disinfection\"--",
