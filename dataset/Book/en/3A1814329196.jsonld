            "abstract": "The major purpose of this book is to present Johann Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) in a real and interesting way based on the most recent historical research and analysis of authentic sources. The authors aim to show Mendel´s scientific thinking and inner feelings together with his environment and to communicate his message as a multifaceted personality and modern experimentalist. The book draws from the only existing short sketch of Mendel´s youth, his letters and the biographical ceiling paintings that were made according to his proposal. They form the basis of the self-portrait concept. The structure of the book follows thematic groups covering Mendel´s activities from a poor village boy in search for education and financial security, as not being physically suitable for running his father&apos;s farm. The book does not perpetuate the myths invented by some creative authors to make Mendel´s biography more attractive. Mendel´s life and work are dramatic enough without those embellishments. Mendel found happiness in science and he was able to explain the theory of new scientific facts. He was not a tragic figure, he did not work to become famous, but to be useful. His pea research has now been appreciated as a genius accomplishment of a scientist. The book is published at the occasion of Mendel´s birthday bicentennial.",
