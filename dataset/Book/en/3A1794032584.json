                "This edited volume deals with the understanding of the issues concerned with the pollution caused by toxic elements and heavy metals and their impacts on the different agro-ecosystems as well as the techniques involved in sustainable remediation and amelioration of polluted soils. Furthermore, the book is a detailed comprehensive account for the treatment technologies from unsustainable to sustainable which includes chapters prepared by professionals with expertise in environmental microbiology, biotechnology, bioremediation, and environmental engineering. It focuses on the characterization, reclamation, bioremediation, and phytoremediation of polluted soils. The research presented also highlights some of the significantly important plant and microbial species involved in remediation, the physiology, biochemistry, and the mechanisms of remediation by various plants and microbes, and suggestions for future improvement of bioremediation technology. It offers insights into the current focus and recent advances in bioremediation and green technology applications for sustainable soil management.",
