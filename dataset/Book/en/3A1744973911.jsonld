                "Issues and challenges surrounding corporate governance in entrepreneurial firms remain relatively unexamined. The Handbook of Research on Corporate Governance and Entrepreneurship brings together leading academic experts within their specific fields to examine the most important issues surrounding corporate governance in various entrepreneurial settings, including start-ups, owner-managed firms, fast-growing firms and IPOs. The Handbook also considers how corporate governance and board leadership is associated with entrepreneurship and innovation in mature companies. Detailed chapters span a wide range of topics, methodologies and levels of analysis, all designed to contribute to advancements in the understanding of corporate governance in entrepreneurial firms. The Handbook begins with a succinct investigation into governance and entrepreneurship as a research field, followed by clearly delineated and thematic parts dedicated to different business settings. Key topics include governance in early stage, high-tech ventures and dynamics of governance structures in high-growth, high-potential firms. This innovative Handbook will provide fresh insights and unique practical perspectives for advanced students and academics in business management and entrepreneurship. Collectively, the chapters provide new insights into the topic across different organizational and geographical settings and offer guidance to practitioners and policy-makers working within these domains"
