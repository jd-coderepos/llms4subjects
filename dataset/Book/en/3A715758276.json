            "abstract": "\"There is growing recognition that the environmental quality of workplaces has a measurable impact on health, wellbeing and hence productivity. There is also increasing evidence that the environmental design of classrooms enhances learning and that green schools bring wider social and economic benefits beyond that of reduced energy consumption. The third edition of Green Buildings Pay presents new evidence and new arguments concerning the institutional and business case that can be made for green design. Green Buildings Pay examines, through case studies of commercial and educational buildings, how different approaches to green design can produce more sustainable patterns of development. Completely revised with all new chapters, cases, sections and introductory material the third edition provides the reader with:Over 20 new researched case studies drawn from the UK, Europe and the USA/CanadaExamples of buildings of high sustainable and high architectural quality Coverage of office buildings, universities, colleges and schools Each case study is written in collaboration with the architects, engineers, clients and user groups Cases which demonstrate current practice in the area of energy/eco-retrofits of existing buildingsDocumentation of the beneficial impact assessment schemes such as LEED and BREEAM have had upon client expectations and on design approaches over the past decadeBeautiful full colour illustrations throughout The green argument has moved a long way forward since the last edition and this is an extremely timely updating of a book which addresses some of the key bottom line issues faced by architect, engineer and client today. \"--",
