This second edition has been updated to include references to using technology that will help dyslexic children reinforce their mathematical skills and also contains a number of photocopiable resources that can be used in the classroom. Written by Anne Henderson, who is experienced in teaching language and mathematics to pupils with dyslexia, this book outlines current thinking in the field and shows how the research methods that have been proven as successful can be used with whole classes of children. This book encourages flexible methods and gives teachers the confidence to discuss alternative solutions with their pupils and help them achieve success.
