The proposed specifications are designed to help highway agencies evaluate between comparable designs of lightweight and normal weight concrete bridge elements so that an agency&apos;s ultimate selection will yield the greatest economic benefit. The attachments contained in the research agency&apos;s final report provide elaborations and detail on several aspects of the research.  Attachments A and B provide proposed changes to AASHTO LRFD bridge design and bridge construction specifications, respectively; these are included in the print and PDF version of the report.  Attachments C through R are available for download below.    Attachments C, D, and E contain a detailed literature review, survey results, and a literature summary and the approved work plan, respectively.  Attachment C; Attachment D ; Attachment E; Attachments F through M provide details of the experimental program that were not able to be included in the body of this report.   Attachment F; Attachment G; Attachment H; Attachment I; Attachment J; Attachment K; Attachment L; Attachment M.  Attachments N through Q present design examples of bridges containing lightweight concrete and details of the parametric study.  Attachment N; Attachment O; Attachment P; Attachment Q.   Attachment R is a detailed reference list.\"--Publication information",
