                "\"A memoir by Doc Hendley, a bartender turned renegade savior, who has supplied clean drinking water to over 30,000 people by rebuilding wells in war-torn and impoverished areas, including Sudan, Northern Uganda, Ethiopia, Cambodia, India, Perus, and most recently, Haiti. Hendley reflects on his experiences--many of which are extremely harrowing--and sounds a call to action\"--",
                "\" The captivating story of an ordinary bartender who&apos;s changing the world through clean water. Doc Hendley never set out to be a hero. In 2004, Hendley-a small- town bartender- launched a series of wine-tasting events to raise funds for clean-water projects and to bring awareness to the world&apos;s freshwater crisis. He planned to donate the proceeds through traditional channels, but instead found himself traveling to one of the world&apos;s most dangerous hot spots: Darfur, Sudan. There, Doc witnessed a government-sponsored genocide where the number-one weapon wasn&apos;t bullets-it was water. The Janjaweed terrorists had figured out that shooting up a bladder containing 10,000 liters of water, or dumping rotting corpses into a primary water source is remarkably efficient for the purposes of mass extermination. With limited funds, Doc realized that he couldn&apos;t build new wells costing $10,000 a pop, but he could hire local workers to restore a damaged well for a mere $50 each. He&apos;d found his mission. Today, Doc and Wine to Water continue to help stricken peoples repair and maintain water- containment systems in places like Darfur, Cambodia, Uganda, and Haiti. Doc is a regular, rough-and-tumble guy who loves booze, music, and his Harley- but he also wanted to help. Wine to Water is a gripping story about braving tribal warfare and natural disasters and encountering fascinating characters in far-flung regions of the world. It is also an authoritative account of a global crisis and an inspirational tale that proves how ordinary people can improve the world. \"--"
