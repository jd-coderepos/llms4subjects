                "This heavily revised second edition defines the current state of the art for informatics education in medicine and healthcare. This field has continued to undergo considerable changes as the field of informatics continues to evolve. The book features extensively revised chapters addressing the latest developments in areas including relevant informatics concepts for those who work in health information technology and those teaching informatics courses in clinical settings, techniques for teaching informatics with limited resources, and the use of online modalities in bioinformatics research education. New topics covered include how to get appropriate accreditation for an informatics program, data science and bioinformatics education, and undergraduate health informatics education. Informatics Education in Healthcare: Lessons Learned addresses the broad range of informatics education programs and available techniques for teaching informatics. It therefore provides a valuable reference for all involved in informatics education."
