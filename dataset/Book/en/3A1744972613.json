                "Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Managing and organizing are now central phenomena in contemporary societies. It is essential that they are studied from a variety of perspectives, and with equal attention paid to their past, their present and their future. This book collects opinions of trailblazing scholars concerning the most important research topics, essential for study in the next 15-20 years. The opinions concern both traditional functions, such as accounting and marketing, personnel management and strategy, technology and communication, but also new challenges, such as diversity, equality, waste and cultural encounters. The collection is intended to be inspirational for young scholars and an invitation to a dialogue with practitioners. The book&apos;s contributions are written by well-established scholars. Each is a leader in their field and will remain important figures for the next 20 years and beyond. Each chapter starts with a short summary of the present situation but focuses on the future of the discipline. The contributors cover practically all subfields of what is called business administration, or management and organization studies, containing topics that are new, such as invisible organizations or encounters between art, popular culture and organizing. Outlining the future and the state of the art, this comprehensive and innovative book is an essential resource for students and academics seeking to be at the forefront of future research in management and organization studies",
