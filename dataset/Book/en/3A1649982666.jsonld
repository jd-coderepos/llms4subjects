            "abstract": "Professor K. P. Ghatak is the First Recipient of the Degree of Doctor of Engineering of Jadavpur University in 1991 since the University inception in 1955 and in the same year he received the prestigious Indian National Science Academy award. He joined as Lecturer in the Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics of the University of Calcutta in 1983, Reader in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication of Jadavpur University in 1987 and Professor in the Department of Electronic Science of the University of Calcutta in 1994 respectively. His present research interest is nanostructured science and technology. He is the principal co-author of more than 200 research papers on Semiconductor and Nanoscience in eminent peer-reviewed International Journals and more than 50 research papers in the Proceedings of the International Conferences held in USA and many of his papers are being cited many times. Professor Ghatak is the invited Speaker of SPIE, MRS, etc. and is the referee of different eminent Journals. He is the supervisor of more than 34 Ph.D candidates among which 24 have already been awarded their respective Ph.D degrees, 6 are working at present and 4 are writing their respective Ph.D. thesis in various aspects of materials and nanoscience and many of them are working as Professor, Reader and Lecturer in different Universities. He is the principal co-author of the two research monographs entitled \"Einstein Relation in Compound Semiconductors and Their Nanostructures\" Springer Series in Materials Science, Vol. 116, ISBN 978-3-540-79556-8 which is the first book on Einstein relation and contains many open research problems and \"Photoemission from Optoelectronic materials and their nanostructures\", which will be published from Springer, USA in 2009 and presently in the press as the first book solely devoted to Photoemission from nanostructured optoelectronic materials. The All Indian Council For Technical Education has selected the first Research  Development project in his life for the best project award in Electronics and second best research project award considering all the branches of Engineering for the year 2006. The present book is being written under the grant (8023/BOR/RID/RPS-95/2007-08) as sanctioned by the said Council in their reserach promotion scheme 2008. Dr. S. Bhattacharya obtained his M. Sc. Degree in Electronic Science of the University of Calcutta in 2003 and is presently working in the Centre for Electronics Design and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. His Ph. D. work involves the investigations of transport properties of different quantized structures under various external conditions. He is the co-author of the two aforementioned research monographs and 30 scientific research papers in different aspects of quantized structures in international peer-reviewed journals of high repute. His present research interests are the quantum effect devices and nonlinearities. He became the Invited Speaker at the XXIXth International Union of Radio Science, URSI.",
