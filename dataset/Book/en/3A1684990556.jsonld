                "Nanoimprinting has grown rapidly since it was proposed in 1995 by Prof. Chou. Now machines, resins, and molds for nanoimprinting are commercially available worldwide. The application fields of nanoimprinting are expanding to not only electronics but also optics, biology, and energy because nanoimprinting is a simple and convenient method for nanofabrication, and some devices are now being mass-produced. In the near future, the application of nanoimprinting in display and semiconductor fields is expected. This book explains the fundamentals of nanoimprinting in terms of materials, processes, and machines. It also describes the applications of nanoimprinting in optics, biology, energy, and electronics. In addition, it includes as many practical examples of nanoimprinting as possible. The fundamentals will help advanced undergraduate and graduate students understand nanoimprinting. The examples will be useful for both researchers working in nanoimprinting for the first time and engineers involved in research and development of various devices using nanostructures",
