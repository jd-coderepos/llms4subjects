            "abstract": "\"Preface Traditional security mechanisms restrict access to authorized users only, in order to protect resources from malicious users. However, in many contexts, we must protect ourselves from those who offer resources, so that the problem is in fact reversed. This improper usage cannot be addressed by traditional security mechanisms, and the issues relate more to trustworthiness than security. Trust is a vital factor in our daily coexistence with other people, who can be unpredictable. Trust helps to reduce the uncertainty caused by this unpredictability to an acceptable level. The notion of trust includes trust management systems. These systems gather information required for creating a trust relationship and dynamically monitor and fine-tune present relationships. Thus, trust management provides a basis for cooperation to develop. The schemes include both centralized and distributed approaches. The main aim of this book is to provide relevant theoretical frameworks and the latest research findings in the area of trust management. This includes cross-disciplinary examination of fundamental issues underpinning computational trust models. The book thoroughly discusses various trust management processes for dynamic open systems and their applications. Moreover, most of the chapters are written in a tutorial style so that even readers without a specialized knowledge of the subject can easily grasp some of the ideas in this area. There are 21 chapters in this book which discuss trust and security in cloud computing, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, autonomic networks, multiagent systems, vehicular ad hoc networks, digital rights management, e-commerce, e-governance, embedded computing, and a number of other topics\"--",
