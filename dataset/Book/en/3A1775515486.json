                "\"In recent years, microplastics (MPs) have received special attention from the mass media and scientific community. MPs are ubiquitously found all over the world, from overpopulated to remote regions. Until now, studies on MPs is mainly focused on marine environments. Freshwater environments are reported as the main sources of MPs to the oceans, however, knowledge of MPs in the environments is insufficient. This chapter reviewed the potential sources and pathways of MPs in freshwater environments. A summary of the analytical methods for sample collection, preparation, and analysis of MPs was also presented. Furthermore, the global distribution of MPs in river and lake systems was also reported. This review showed that MPs have been found ubiquitously in freshwater environments from remote to densely populated areas. The MPs pollution in China was reported higher than in other parts of the world. The main pathways of MPs into freshwater environments include effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and solid waste collection, processing, and land-filling. For the sampling of water samples, plankton nets or manta trawls with an aperture size of 333 m are used in most studies. For the sampling of river bottom sediments, most studies employed grab samplers, while grab or corers were used for lake sediment. The extraction of MPs from sample matrices was conducted mainly with saturated sodium chloride as it is inexpensive and environmentally friendly. The visual sorting of MPs is conducted mainly by dissection microscope, however, this is a time-consuming process and can create miss-identification or underestimation of MPs. The polymer types of MPs are commonly identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Since different methods are used for collecting and analysis of MPs by different researchers, it hampers consistency and comparison between studies. Thus, the development of standard methods should be one of the top priorities for further studies on MPs\"--"
