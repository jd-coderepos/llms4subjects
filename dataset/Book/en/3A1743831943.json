            "abstract": "\"SRv6 Network Programming, beginning with the challenges for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) network development, describes the background, design roadmap, and implementation of Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6), as well as the application of this technology in traditional and emerging services. The book starts off with the development of IP technologies by focusing on the problems encountered during MPLS and IPv6 network development, giving readers insights into the problems tackled by SRv6 and the value of SRv6. It then goes on to explain SRv6 fundamentals, including SRv6 packet header design, the packet forwarding process, protocol extensions such as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions, and how SRv6 supports existing traffic engineering (TE), virtual private networks (VPN), and reliability requirements. After that, SRv6 network deployment is introduced, covering the evolution paths from existing networks to SRv6 networks, SRv6 network deployment processes, involved O&amp;M technologies, and emerging 5G and cloud services supported by SRv6. Then, Bit Index Explicit Replication IPv6 encapsulation (BIERv6), an SRv6 multicast technology, is introduced as an important supplement to SRv6 unicast technology. The book concludes with a summary of the current situation of the SRv6 industry and provides an outlook for new SRv6-based technologies. The book collects the research results of Huawei SRv6 experts and reflects the latest development direction of SRv6. With rich, clear, practical, and easy-to-understand content, the volume is intended for network planning engineers, technical support engineers and network administrators who need a grasp of the most cutting-edge IP network technology. It is also intended for communications network researchers in scientific research institutions and universities\"--",
