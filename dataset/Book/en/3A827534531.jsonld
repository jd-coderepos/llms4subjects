                "\"Statistics can be a fun and enlightening course for both students and teachers. From our years of experience in the classroom, we have found that an effective way to make statistics interesting is to use timely business applications to which students can relate. If interest can be sparked at the outset, students may end up learning statistics without realizing they are doing so. By carefully matching timely applications with statistical methods,students learn to appreciate the relevance of business statistics in our world today. We wrote Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers because we saw a need for a contemporary, core statistics textbook that sparked student interest and bridged the gap between how statistics is taught and how practitioners think about and apply statistical methods. Throughout the text, the emphasis is on communicating with numbers rather than on number crunching. In every chapter, students are exposed to statistical information conveyed in written form\"--",
                "\"Overview:  The first edition of Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers provides a unique, innovative, and engaging learning experience for students studying Business Statistics.  It is an intellectually stimulating, practical, and visually attractive textbook, from which students can learn and instructors can teach. Throughout the book, the authors have presented the material in an accessible way by using timely business applications to which students can relate.  Although the text is application-oriented, it is also mathematically sound and uses notation that is generally accepted for the topic being covered. \"--"
