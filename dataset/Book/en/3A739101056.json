                "This book provides a concise and well balanced overview of the functionality in MATLAB(p)ʾ. It facilitates independent learning with coverage of both the fundamentals and applications in two parts. The essentials of MATLAB are illustrated throughout with many examples from a wide range of familiar scientific and engineering areas, as well as from everyday life. This is an ideal textbook for a first course on MATLAB or an engineering problem solving course using MATLAB, as well as a self-learning tutorial for professionals and students who are expected to learn and apply MATLAB themselves. New to this edition: Updated with the features of Matlab R2012bExpanded discussion of writing functions and scriptsAdditional coverage of formatted output, including more discussion on fprintfMore exercises and examples throughoutNew chapters on Symbolic Math and SIMULINK(p)ʾ toolboxesCompanion website for the reader, providing M-files used within the book and selected solutions to end of chapter problems.
