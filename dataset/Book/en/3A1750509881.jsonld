            "abstract": "\"Increasing demand on improving the resiliency of modern structures and infrastructure requires ever more critical and complex designs. Therefore, the need for accurate and efficient approaches to assess uncertainties in loads, geometry, material properties, manufacturing processes, and operational environments has increased significantly. Reliability-based techniques help develop more accurate initial guidance for robust design and help to identify the sources of significant uncertainty in structural systems. This book presents an overview of the methods of classical reliability analysis and design most associated with structural reliability. It also introduces more modern methods and advancements, and emphasizes the most useful methods and techniques used in reliability and risk studies, and elaborating their practical applications and limitations rather than detailed derivations. Features : provides a practical and comprehensive overview of reliability and risk analysis and design techniques. Introduces resilient and smart structures/infrastructure that will lead to more reliable and sustainable societies. Considers loss elimination, risk management and life-cycle asset management as related to infrastructure projects. Introduces probability theory, statistical methods, and reliability analysis methods. Reliability-Based Analysis and Design of Structures and Infrastructure is suitable for researchers and practicing engineers, as well as upper-level students taking related courses in structural reliability analysis and design\"--",
