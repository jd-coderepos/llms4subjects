            "abstract": "\"In the recent past, studies on radon and their progenies have drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community and researchers, due to their crucial role as a possible cause of cancer, monitoring radiation levels of nuclear installations and as a potential precursor parameter to seismic events. This book titled \"Radon: Detection, Exposure and Control\" has 19 chapters comprising of research contributions from across the globe namely; Brazil, Spain, Norway, Ireland, Russia, Taiwan (PRC), Iran, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and several regions of India including the seismic zone-V, the second highest seismic zone in the world. This book is very useful to scholars pursuing post-graduate studies and research covering broad areas of applied sciences namely; geophysics, Earth science, geoscience, geochemistry and civil &amp; geotechnical engineering. This book provides a mixed flavour of the recent trends in several types of research works related to detection, exposure and control of Radon (Rn222, Rn220) in a concise and interesting manner. This book contains several chapters dedicated to the radon measurement based radioactivity studies in rocks, over kimberlite pipes, inside soil and in open environments. The book also describes indoor radon gas concentration studies in schools and other working places including the assessment of health risk associated with it including radon exposure, its measurement and protection. In addition to the influence of regional and geophysical characteristics on the volumetric activity of radon, this book also contains the radon-based biometric characterization of person identification. Review articles on a detailed study of fault traces in Taiwan using soil gas geochemistry and the role of radon as precursor to earthquake have also been discussed including psychological perspective of radon risk and remediation\"--",
