            "abstract": "Describes how a quirky band of misfit science students at Berkeley in the 1970s altered the course of modern physics while studying quantum theory alongside Eastern mysticism and psychic mind reading while lounging in hot tubs and dabbling with LSD. Today, quantum information theory is among the most exciting scientific frontiers, attracting billions of dollars in funding and thousands of talented researchers. But as the author, a MIT physicist and historian reveals, this cutting-edge field has a surprisingly psychedelic past. This book introduces us to a band of freewheeling physicists who defied the imperative to \"shut up and calculate\" and helped to rejuvenate modern physics. For physicists, the 1970s were a time of stagnation. Jobs became scarce, and conformity was encouraged, sometimes stifling exploration of the mysteries of the physical world. Dissatisfied, underemployed, and eternally curious, an eccentric group of physicists in Berkeley, California, banded together to throw off the constraints of the physics mainstream and explore the wilder side of science. Dubbing themselves the \"Fundamental Fysiks Group,\" they pursued an audacious, speculative approach to physics. They studied quantum entanglement and Bell&apos;s Theorem through the lens of Eastern mysticism and psychic mind-reading, discussing the latest research while lounging in hot tubs. Some even dabbled with LSD to enhance their creativity. Unlikely as it may seem, these iconoclasts spun modern physics in a new direction, forcing mainstream physicists to pay attention to the strange but exciting underpinnings of quantum theory. A story that illuminates the relationship between creativity and scientific progress, this work takes us to a time when only the unlikeliest heroes could break the science world out of its rut",
