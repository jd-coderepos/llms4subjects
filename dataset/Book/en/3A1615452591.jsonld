                "\"The society, politics and future of Cuba are high on the world&apos;s agenda in the 21st century. Published in association with the Absolut Art Award, Dangerous Moves presents a fascinating survey of contemporary life and culture in Cuba through some of its most daring and experimental artists. Coco Fusco analyses the ways in which the regime has wielded influence over artists in recent times, showing how - in a context in which overt political speech is subject to censorship - the language of performance has emerged as the favoured means of social commentary. Focusing on a range of performative practices in visual art, music, poetry and political activism, Fusco examines the relationship between the abject body in performance and the greater body politic of a state officially defined as revolutionary yet seeking to limit and constrain dissent. A major new piece of scholarship from a global artist, writer and thinker, this is a key addition to the canon of contemporary art writing, and will be essential reading for students and scholars as well as those with a broader interest in politics, power and contemporary art.\"--Publisher&apos;s description",
