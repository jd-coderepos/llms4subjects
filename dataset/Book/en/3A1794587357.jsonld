                "Large wildland fires of increasing frequency and severity pose an enormous threat to local populations, natural resources, and contribute carbon and particulate emissions to the earth-climate system. This Research Topic will address our current understanding of wildland fires, with a specific focus on engineering approaches to understand and mitigate the harmful effects of fires. Approaches such as scale modeling in laboratory experiments, field campaigns, remote sensing and numerical modeling are all critical tools to enhance our understanding of fires and to develop new approaches to mitigate their harmful effects. Topics of interest include: understanding how fires spread through and burn vegetative fuels, wildland-urban interface fires and their effects on communities, risk analysis, real-time modeling, fire emissions and its effects on health and climate, firefighter safety technology and new approaches to detect, suppress and mitigate fires. Wildland fires represent a challenging interdisciplinary problem and these topics and approaches to solving them are not exclusive. By focusing on a wide variety of approaches to study and mitigate the harmful effects of wildland fires, we hope to present a review of the state-of-the-art in the field through this open-access collection.",
                "This eBook is a collection of articles from a Frontiers Research Topic. Frontiers Research Topics are very popular trademarks of the Frontiers Journals Series: they are collections of at least ten articles, all centered on a particular subject. With their unique mix of varied contributions from Original Research to Review Articles, Frontiers Research Topics unify the most influential researchers, the latest key findings and historical advances in a hot research area!
