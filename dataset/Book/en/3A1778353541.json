                "This book aims to emphasize on basic concepts of plant growth, acclimation, and their adaptation to environment in changing conditions. The book will provide an updated perspective on the physical/mechanical stress, including biotic and abiotic stress, and induced responses in higher plants. This volume will also include a view of the stress recognition by plants and the cell signaling events triggered as a consequence, and will also address an appraisal of the plant oxidative stress metabolism under those circumstances. The book will explore how soil minerals and microbes are affecting plant growth, including elicitors and novel compounds which stimulate plant growth and the defence mechanisms issued by plants. This volume will also cover an overview on the enzymes which may regulate plant growth, as well as the evidences of the involvement of phytohormones and other signalling molecules in plant growth."
