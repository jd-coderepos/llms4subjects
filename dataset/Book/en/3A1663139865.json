                "\"In this comprehensive volume, Rainer Eisfeld draws judicious lessons from his long-time involvement in international debated about what political science does - and what it should be able to achieve. Highlighting problems too rarely confronted by \"mainstream\" political scientists, the book&apos;s innovative chapters explore salient contemporary issues in a manner apt to stir up conventional thinking: the non-relevance of political science research for improving the human condition; today&apos;s deficient political pluralism; the susceptibility of political science to authoritarian temptations; the fatal extent of American &apos;Gun-mindedness&apos;; the discipline&apos;s development in post-communist countries, overshadowed by the emergence of hybrid regimes. Tying together a dozen original contributions with a determined emphasis on participatory politics, Eisfeld demonstrates how &apos;radical&apos; approaches promote the sort of political science that does not shy away from incorporating historical dynamics, societal conflicts, and embedded power relations.\"--Page 4 of cover",
