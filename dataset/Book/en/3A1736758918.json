                "\"Now in its fifth edition, Analysing Architecture has become internationally established as the best introduction to architecture. Aimed primarily at those studying architecture, it offers a clear and accessible insight into the workings of this rich and fascinating subject. With copious illustrations from his own notebooks, the author dissects examples from around the world and all periods of history to explain underlying strategies in architectural design and show how drawing may be used as a medium for analysis. This new edition of Analysing Architecture is revised and expanded. Notably, the chapter on &apos;How Analysis Helps Design&apos; has been redeveloped to clearly explain this crucially important subject to a beginner audience. Two new chapters have been added to the section on &apos;Themes in Spatial Organisation&apos;, covering &apos;Axis&apos;, and &apos;The Hidden&apos;. The &apos;Introduction&apos; has been completely rewritten and the format revised. Works of architecture are instruments for managing, orchestrating, modifying our relationship with the world around us. They frame just about everything we do. Architecture is complex, subtle, frustrating... but ultimately extremely rewarding. It can be a difficult discipline to get to grips with; nothing in school quite prepares anyone for the particular demands of an architecture course. But this book will help\"--"
