                "For over three decades OJB has practiced at the forefront of landscape architecture and urban planning, garnering acclaim for its visionary approach to creating landscapes and public spaces that are highly sustainable, keenly attuned to their environments and communities, and feature an exceptional palette of plantings applied in bold compositions. In its first monograph, Envisioning Landscapes, OJB presents recent projects in a range of typologies, from restorative gardens and neighborhood parks to transformational urban developments that have brought new life to city centers. -",
                "Founded in 1989 by landscape architect James Burnett, OJB [the Office of James Burnett] has since grown to nearly one hundred professionals working across five offices and has established itself as a leader in the field for its ambitious approach to community-building through landscape. At its core, the firm believes that landscape is a social and collective tool for integration, reclamation, and healing. This principle guides all of the firm&apos;s projects across sectors, from its designs promoting restorative healthcare, such as campuses for hospitals and wellness centers, to large-scale urban landscapes conceived to reconnect and revitalize communities, such as the acclaimed Myriad Botanical Gardens and the other initiatives completed as part of Oklahoma City&apos;s Project 180 public works program. This book highlights OJB&apos;s remarkable and meaningful work and the philosophy that drives it through projects of varied typologies arranged in a rhythm progressing from single works to longer multi-project narratives in which landscapes connect and build on each other over several years to create thoughtfully realized and impactful environments"
