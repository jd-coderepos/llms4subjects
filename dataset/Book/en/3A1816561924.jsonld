            "abstract": "\"The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples, and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. Software Design by Example: A Tool-Based Introduction with JavaScript therefore build small versions of the things programmers use in order to demystify them and give some insights into how experienced programmers think. From a file backup system and a testing framework to a regular expression matcher, a browser layout engine, and a very small compiler, we explore common design patterns, show how making code easier to test also makes it easier to re-use, and help readers understand how debuggers, profilers, package managers, and version control systems work so that they can use them more effectively. This material can be used for self-paced study, in an undergraduate course on software design, or as the core of an intensive week-long workshop for working programmers. Each chapter has a set of exercises ranging in size and difficulty from half a dozen lines to a full day&apos;s work. Readers should be familiar with the basics of modern JavaScript, but the more advanced features of the language are explained and illustrated as they are introduced.

All proceeds from sale of this book will go to support the Red Door Family Shelter in Toronto. Features Teaches software design by showing programmers how to build the tools they use every day. Each chapter includes exercises to help readers check and deepen their understanding. All the example code can be downloaded, re-used, and modified under an open license\"--",
