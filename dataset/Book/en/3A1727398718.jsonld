            "abstract": "\"The opening study in this compilation compares variations of the fatty acid profile from cocoa butter as a function of the harvest periods, extraction methods and roasting treatments. The cocoa butter extraction is performed using Soxhlet solvent extraction according to AOAC, 2000 and mechanical pressing following the procedure reported by Bernardini, 1981. Following this, the aroma compounds from fermented, dried and roasted beans from fine-flavored Criollo cocoas of Venezuela are studied. These compounds are associated with nice odoriferous notes. The authors also examine Cuban cacao, the closest relation to the original introduction in Cuba which is endangered by its progressive replacement by commercial clones. Additionally, the authors study some structural and physicochemical changes of cocoa beans fermented in plastic baskets covered with Musaceae leaves for five days in Barlovento, Miranda state, Venezuela. The origin of fine-flavored cocoa is discussed based on its requirements for optimal production of highly aromatic fruits as a function of growth requirements such as humid terrain, warm climate, recurrent rain and characteristic fauna and flora. The closing study focuses on control methods for cacao frosty pod rot, an aggressive disease responsible for great losses and the deterioration of raw material in Colombia for over two centuries\"--",
