                "Chapter 6 presents the concept of support vector machine (SVM) to analyze dataand recognize patterns, required for classification and regression analysis. Twoapplications of SVMs including classification and regression are discussed in thischapter, and examples on using SVM for both mentioned purposes are presented.Examples and models of SVM are presented in MATLAB.",
                "Chapter 4 focuses on methods of time series analysis and modeling. Preprocessingof time series before being used through modeling containing assessment of differentcomponents is discussed in this chapter. Autoregressive (AR), autoregressive movingaverage (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), andautoregressive moving averagewith eXogenous data (ARMAX)models are presentedand discussed in this chapter. A review on the multivariate analysis of time seriesmodeling is added. Two major applications of time series modeling, namely, forecastingand synthetic data generation, are presented, supported by the related syntaxesand programs in MATLAB.",
                "Chapter 5 deals with the artificial neural networks (ANNs). It presents basicdefinition on the “Components of an ANN,” “Training Algorithm,” and “Mappingby ANNs.” The chapter also deals with the introduction of famous ANN models,which are widely used in different fields. Theoretical background, network architecture,their training and simulation methods, as well as the codes necessary forapplying the networks are presented in this section. After presenting each networksample, applications are discussed in different illustrative examples. In this chapter,static and dynamic networks and also statistical networks are those which are described and modeled in MATLAB.",
                "Chapter 7 is concerned with the fuzzy logic. Basic information in fuzzy logic,fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference systems, and fuzzy regression are the main subjectspresented in this chapter. Obviously, the related MATLAB commands arepresented to support the models reviewed in this chapter.",
                "Chapter 8 begins with a summary on the characteristics of the models presentedin the previous chapters. The models are compared based on different criteria togive the readers ideas on how to take advantages of the models’ strengths and avoidtheir weaknesses through the hybrid models and multi-model data fusion approach.The chapter continues with the examples of hybrid models and general techniquesof multi-model data fusion.",
                "Chapter 3 presents models for point and interval estimation of dependent variablesusing different regression methods. Multiple linear regression model, conventionalnonlinear regression models, logistic regression model, and K-nearest neighbornonparametric model are presented in different sections of this chapter. Eachmodel is supported by related commands and programs provided in MATLAB.",
                "Chapter 2 presents discrete and continues probability distribution functions. Sinceone of the most applicable fields of distribution functions is frequency analysis,dealing with this issue is also presented in this chapter. The hypothetical tests onthe average and variance of one and two populations are reviewed in the chapter.Furthermore, two famous tests of chi-square and Kolmogorov–Smirnov are presentedto decide on the best distribution function for a specific random variable. Each of theabove calculations is supported by related commands provided in MATLAB.",
                "The purpose of writing this book has been to give a systematic account of majorconcepts andmethodologies of data-drivenmodels and to present a unified frameworkthatmakes the subjectmore accessible and applicable to researchers and practitioners.The book is structured to integrate important theories and applications on data-drivenmodels and to use them in a wide range of problems in the field of water resources andenvironmental engineering. The presented models are useful for various applications,namely, hydrological forecasting, flood analysis, water quality monitoring, quantitativeand qualitative modeling of water resources, regionalizing climatic data, andgeneral function approximation. This book addresses the issue of data-drivenmodeling in two contexts. Theoretical background of the models and techniques ispresented and discussed in a comparative manner, briefly. Also the source files ofrelative programs demonstrating how to use the explained models are presented withpractical advice on how to advance them. The programs have been developed withinthe unified platform of MATLAB. The proposed models are applied in variousillustrative examples as well as several workshops. The focus of the book remains astraightforward presentation of explained models by discussing in detail the necessarycomponents and briefly touching on the more advanced components.The book is served as a practical guide to the main audience of graduate studentsand researchers in water resources engineering, environmental engineering, agriculturalengineering, and natural resources engineering. This book may also beadapted for use as a senior undergraduate and graduate textbook by selective choiceof topics. Alternatively, it may also be used as a resource for practicing engineers,consulting engineers, and others involved in water resources and environmentalengineering.The book contains eight chapters; except first and last, each was developed intwo parts of theory and practice to achieve the aim of the book.",
                "Chapter 1 lays the foundation for the entire book with a brief review on differenttypes of models that could be used for modeling water resources and environmentalproblems as well as the process of model selection for a specific problem. Furthermore,the general approach of using data-driven models is reviewed in this chapter."
