            "abstract": "This book presents deliberations on the molecular and genomic mechanisms underlying the interactions of crop plants with the biotic stresses caused by insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and oomycetes, etc. important to develop resistant crop varieties. Knowledge on the advanced genetic and genomic crop improvement strategies including molecular breeding, transgenics, genomic-assisted breeding and the recently emerging genome editing for developing resistant varieties in fruit crops is imperative for addressing FPNEE (food, health, nutrition. energy and environment) security. Whole genome sequencing of these crops followed by genotyping-by-sequencing have facilitated precise information about the genes conferring resistance useful for gene discovery, allele mining and shuttle breeding which in turn opened up the scope for &apos;designing&apos; crop genomes with resistance to biotic stresses. The nine chapters, each dedicated to a fruit crop in this volume, deliberate on different types of biotic stress agents and their effects on and interaction with the crop plants; enumerate the available genetic diversity with regard to biotic stress resistance among available cultivars; illuminate on the potential gene pools for utilization in interspecific gene transfer; present brief on the classical genetics of stress resistance and traditional breeding for biotic stress resistance; depict the success stories of genetic engineering for developing biotic stress resistant varieties; discuss on molecular mapping of genes and QTLs underlying biotic stress resistance and their marker-assisted introgression into elite varieties; enunciate different emerging genomics-aided techniques including genomic selection, allele mining, gene discovery and gene pyramiding for developing resistant crop varieties with higher quantity and quality of yield; and also elaborate some case studies on genome editing focusing on specific genes for generating disease and insect resistant crops.",
