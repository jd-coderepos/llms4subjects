Readers will be able to achieve a thorough&amp;nbsp;grounding in the technology and its applications and at every stage, the technology is presented through applications examples from business, as well as other fields,&amp;nbsp;giving the reader a chance to concretely think through the details and issues that often arise.&amp;nbsp;  By using this textbook, the student will be able to achieve: &lt;ul style=\"line-height: 25px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13.3333px;\"&gt;  Lasting hands-on knowledge of a pervasive and useful technology  Acquisition of immediately marketable skills  Development of analytical thinking and problem solving.  Designing a database is a highly analytical skill, involving breaking down a situation into its critical components and clearly elucidating the relationships between these components. Learning such a skill develops the mind generally, fostering abilities in critical thinking and problem solving. Developing such abilities is an important component of any college education, regardless of students&apos; fields of study\"--",
