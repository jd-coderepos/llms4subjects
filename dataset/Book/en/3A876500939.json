                "\"Welcome to this sixth book in the Wiley Blackwell Industrial and Organisational Psychology series. This title in the series focus is on teams and collaborative processes at work and builds on the previous five titles in the series on leadership and change, coaching and mentoring, training and development, health and safety and positive psychology. Collaboration has for centuries been a key feature of success for any enterprise. Since the industrial revolution and rise of large-scale manufacturing of the nineteenth century, through to the development of global corporations of the twenty first century, team working and collaboration both within and across the organisation boundary is essential. Teams are the only way NASA, Google or IKEA can operate to deliver their products, services or mission. Understanding how to recruit, develop and manage teams is what this book is all about. This title is however just one of eight books in this Series totally over 200 chapters and 2 million words on Industrial and Organisational Psychology, and we believe this is the largest single contribution to the field. We believe this series differs in four ways from other titles in the field\"--",
                "\"A state-of-the-art psychological perspective on team working and collaborative organizational processes&amp;hellip;  This handbook makes a unique contribution to organizational psychology and HRM by providing comprehensive international coverage of the contemporary field of team working and collaborative organizational processes. It provides critical reviews of key topics related to teams including design, diversity, leadership, trust processes and performance measurement, drawing on the work of leading thinkers including Linda Argote, Neal Ashkanasy, Robert Kraut, Floor Rink and Daan van Knippenberg\"--"
