The contributions cover a broad range of issues, distinguishing between in-service and pre-service teachers, examining the results of national surveys and international comparisons of teachers’ pedagogical beliefs, and making use of different methodologies when it comes to operationalisation and measurement. The findings are essential reading for researchers in the fields of education and psychology, pre-service and in-service teachers and teacher trainers.",
