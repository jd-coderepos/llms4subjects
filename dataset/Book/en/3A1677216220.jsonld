            "abstract": "\"The emergence of big data is expected to change business dynamics in different organizations and the value behind big data is evident. Consumer data is traded, sold, and a sought-after commodity. In the next two decades, the volume of data available to different enterprises will grow dramatically. The big data is expected to change insights about the customers, operational costs, and all the relevant aspects of different business models around the world. The emergence of cloud computing has enabled businesses to compete at a higher level because the traditional software and systems are no longer required. Digital heterogeneity and the confluence of Artificial Intelligence with 5G and IoT are expected to dominate the market because the majority of the organizations in the world are considering the use of AI to reduce their operating costs. Even as the future of business technology continues to get brighter, there is a need to reconsider trust, privacy, and risk management issues. As technology continues to advance, the risks become greater, and thus, security becomes a significant aspect that needs to be addressed. In the last few years, new laws have been developed to regulate how service providers collect, use, retain, disclose, and dispose of user information. The number of cyber-attacks and data breaches have been rising at an alarming rate and it is essential for the organization to take necessary precautions to protect their data. In this book, transformation and advancement to a pervasive and converged digital infrastructure of Big Data, IoT and AI with their values, threats and security at different levels are discussed\"--",
