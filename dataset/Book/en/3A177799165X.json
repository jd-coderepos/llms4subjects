            "abstract": "This book provides readers with a comprehensive overview of cold plasma technology for tackling the various food-related hazards in a wide range of food sectors. The principles and characteristics of cold plasma generation in gas and its interaction with liquids, as well as its combating modes of action for common hazards (e.g., bacteria, spores, biofilms, fungi, and fungal toxins) are emphasized in this book. It also presents the applications of cold plasma or its hurdles with other techniques to assure the microbiological safety of the key food classifications, including fruits, vegetables, cereals, grains, meat, aquatic products, liquid food products (e.g., juices, milk), nuts, spices, herbs, and food packaging. This book is useful for researchers to grasp the comprehensive understandings of how food safety can be controlled with cold plasma technology. This book also provides adequate information for engineers in food industry for better development and optimization of the plasma-generating systems. Government institutions that are responsible for food safety regulations can understand more knowledge about the intricacies and influencing factors, which should be considered for regulating the applications of cold plasma technology in food.",
