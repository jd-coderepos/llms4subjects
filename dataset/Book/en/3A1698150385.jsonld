            "abstract": "\"In this innovative book, ten executive politicians with backgrounds in planning from around the world dissect their own political careers. Reflecting on the often structural impact of their work in political decision-making, they also consider the translation of their experiences back into academic life or professional practice. These revealing stories illustrate the vital role of planners in politics. Specific examples show how they were able to make a difference during their tenure by defining problems, setting agendas, using different catalyst for change and raising awareness of issues around sustainability, equity, social justice, poverty and power. Drawing on these experiences to argue for innovative pedagogies and practices in planning, this book illuminates the frequently invisible work of planners in politics, the benefits of their training and education, and the wisdom that they can offer theorists, students and practitioners about transformative planning. This book will be critical reading for researchers and students of spatial planning, urban geography and politics. Urban planners and politicians will also benefit from these insights into the political experience of planning\"--",
