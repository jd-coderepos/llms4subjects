                "This part creates a solid understanding of how user location is managed, security is guaranteed, circuit bearers are established and released, packet traffic flows are maintained and terminal handovers are carried out 3.Increases the reader&apos;s knowledge by explaining how the previous functions are distributed throughout the network by means of communication protocols providing references to the original UMTS standards published by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Program (3GPP) Written by a group of experts in mobile networking, this practical approach will have wide-ranging appeal to system, software and field engineers and technical managers in cellular operator, manufacturer and service provider companies as well as students of telecommunications engineering and computer networks.",
                "Building on the success of the first edition UMTS Networks, 2e provides an outstanding description of 3 rd generation UMTS mobile networking technology. It discusses both the core network evolving from the globally successful GSM/GPRS system and the radio access network based on newly emerged Wideband CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology. UMTS networks will provide a platform for mobile packet data and multimedia services bringing new business opportunities to existing and greenfield cellular operators, manufacturers and internet service and content providers. UMTS networks are introduced in three parts: 1.Explains the overall system design and describes the network elements and functions of a complete UMTS network. It also illustrates how mobile networks evolve from 2 nd generation GSM into first UMTS release and beyond towards full-IP mobility networks 2.Examines the radio access and core network in further detail explaining the functions and services provided to the end users."
