            "abstract": "Diamond, as well as being a precious gem, is a versatile material par excellence. No other material comes anywhere near to matching its properties, which are both extreme, and also expressed in rare combinations. However, natural diamonds, and those synthesised under high sandpressure temperatures, are too expensive or small for many technological applications. These limitations can be overcome by using large-area diamond coatings; chemically bonded to inexpensive non-diamond surfaces. The consequent economic advantages provide the driving force for much diamond-related research and technology. This monograph deals with the past, present and future of diamond thin films. It details their methods of preparation and characterisation, and the mechanisms of nucleation, growth and epitaxy of CVD diamond. Reactor-scale modelling, in situ diagnostics and the processing of diamond films are other important topics that are covered. Expected applications, recent developments and new ideas in the field concluding the monograph. In the near future, applications featuring diamond parts may well grow into whole new industries, with their associated production facilities, supply chains and job opportunities; thereby benefiting society in general. It is therefore in the interests of scientists and engineers working in almost any branch of industry to become familiar with the key concepts and techniques in diamond-coating. This book provides a brief, but complete and authoritative, introduction. Dua, former head of the materials science section at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in India, examines the past, present, and future of diamond thin films. He details their methods of preparation and characterization, and the mechanisms of nucleation, growth, and epitaxy of CVD diamond. Reactor-scale modeling, in situ diagnostics, and the processing of diamond films are some other topics covered. Concluding chapters look ahead to expected applications, recent developments, and new ideas in the field.",
