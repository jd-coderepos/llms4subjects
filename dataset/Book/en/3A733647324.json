This practical resource discusses engineering techniques; long-term biological and environmental effects; dealing with insurance claims, litigation, and legislation in overlapping jurisdictions; and much more. Featuring global case studies and best practices, this timely volume provides an in-depth understanding of how oil spills and gas leaks occur and describes the most effective environmental assessment, remediation, and restoration options available to respond to these industrial accidents. Coverage includes:  The role of petroleum hydrocarbon fuels in society Geology and geochemistry of oil and gas deposits Oil and gas well drilling and production issues Hydraulic fracturing for shale gas and oil Behavior of oil spills in various environments Behavior of gas leaks in various environments Assessment of spills and leaks Toxicity issues and exposure pathways  Subsurface investigations Sampling strategies and remedial approaches Sampling methods on land and offshore  Prevention, oversight, and mitigation  Remediation of oil spills Case histories and cost recovery  Oil spills and wildlife Oil spills and safety issues Conclusions and recommendations \"--"
