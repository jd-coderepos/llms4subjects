            "abstract": "\"This new and updated second edition of Debates in Mathematics Education explores the major issues that mathematics teachers encounter in their daily lives. By engaging with established and contemporary debates, this volume promotes and supports critical reflection and aims to stimulate both novice and experienced teachers to reach informed judgements and argue their point of view with deeper theoretical knowledge and understanding. Divided into five accessible sections, this book investigates and offers fresh insight into topics of central importance in mathematics education, with this second edition including new discussions and chapters on: Classic and contemporary issues of pedagogy, politics, philosophy and sociology of Mathematics education International comparisons of achievement  Digital technologies for teaching Mastery in mathematics Pop culture and mathematics Whether mathematics can be harmful Designed to stimulate discussion and support you in your own research, writing and practice through suggested questions and activities throughout, Debates in Mathematics Education will be a valuable resource for any student or practising teacher, and those engaged in initial teacher training, continuing professional development or Masters level study. This book also has much to offer to those leading mathematics departments in schools and initial teacher education programmes, and to beginning doctoral students looking for a survey of the field of mathematics education research\"--",
