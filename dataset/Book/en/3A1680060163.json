            "abstract": "Gordon Bunshaft&apos;s (1909-1990) landmark 1952 design for Lever House reshaped the Manhattan skyline and elevated the reputation of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), the firm where he would spend more than 40 years as a partner. Although this enigmatic architect left behind few records, his legacy endures in the corporate headquarters, museums, and libraries that were built in his distinctive modernist style. Bunshaft&apos;s career was marked by shifts in material. Glass and steel structures of the 1950s, such as New York&apos;s Chase Manhattan Bank, gave way to revolutionary designs in concrete, such as the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University and the doughnut-shaped Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. Bunshaft&apos;s collaborations with artists, including Isamu Noguchi, Jean Dubuffet, and Henry Moore, were of paramount importance throughout his career. Nicholas Adams explores the contested line between Bunshaft&apos;s ambition for acclaim as a singular artistic genius and the collaborative structure of SOM&apos;s architectural partnership. Bunshaft received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1988 and remains the only SOM partner to have achieved this distinction. Adams counters Bunshaft&apos;s maxim that \"the building speaks for itself\" with necessary critical context about this modernist moment at a time when the future of Bunshaft&apos;s iconic works is very much in question",
