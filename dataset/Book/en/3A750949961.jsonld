It covers applications both in fundamental research and in the regenerative medicine industry for tissue engineering products. Each chapter gives an overview of a particular technique, its advantages and limitations in terms of structural and functional information provided, and examples of applications in regenerative medicine. The book provides a practical guide to the most appropriate techniques for a given application. It also offers a summary of major recent advances, such as use of machine vision for tracking growth of three-dimensional constructs in bioreactors and polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography for monitoring collagen alignment in cartilage growth\"--Provided by publisher",
