            "abstract": "This book systematically presents the theory, numerical implementation, field experiments and practical engineering applications of the ‘Vehicle–Track Coupled Dynamics’. Representing a radical departure from classic vehicle system dynamics and track dynamics, the vehicle–track coupled dynamics theory considers the vehicle and track as one interactive and integrated system coupled through wheel–rail interaction. This new theory enables a more comprehensive and accurate solution to the train–track dynamic interaction problem which is a fundamental and important research topic in railway transportation system, especially for the rapidly developed high-speed and heavy-haul railways. It has been widely applied in practical railway engineering. Dr. Wanming Zhai is a Chair Professor of Railway Engineering at Southwest Jiaotong University, where he is also chairman of the Academic Committee and Director of the Train and Track Research Institute. He is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and one of the leading scientists in railway system dynamics. Professor Zhai is Editor-in-Chief of both the International Journal of Rail Transportation, published by Taylor &amp; Francis Group, and the Journal of Modern Transportation, published by Springer. In addition, he is a trustee of the International Association for Vehicle System Dynamics, Vice President of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and Vice President of the Chinese Society for Vibration Engineering",
