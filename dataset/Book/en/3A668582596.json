            "abstract": "\"Preface With the release of .NET Framework 4 on April 12, 2010, .NET adoption for enterprise application development is growing. With every release of .NET framework, it has improved upon various critical success factors of enterprise application strategy such as Lower TCO, easier development, deployment, improved performance and manageability, endearing itself as a technology of choice. Enterprises already on .NET platform will reap the benefits from .NET Framework 4&apos;s new features while enterprises waiting to adopt .NET platform should seriously consider evaluating and adopting it. However, with the new version of .NET Framework, there are many questions that arise for decision makers in understanding which features are more important, how to use them in various scenarios, etc. We have closely followed the developments in .NET framework throughout last decade and accumulated a lot of experience in building applications, finding solutions and advising customers on new .NET framework adoption over the years. This book tries to distill the knowledge we have gained over the years while consulting with a variety of customers. Here, we provide in depth coverage of various server side features of Microsoft .NET Framework 4 that can be leveraged in bespoke Enterprise Application development. The book provides a stepby- step approach towards building real life implementation using specific .NET 4 features and explains associated code, highlights scenario fitment in enterprise, and includes particular viewpoints that will help. The book is organized into eight chapters. What Does This Book Cover? Chapter 1: .NET4 Core Framework, begins by explaining .NET evolution; and then helps the reader understanding around Common Language Runtime (CLR), and Base Class Library 4(BCL)\"--",
