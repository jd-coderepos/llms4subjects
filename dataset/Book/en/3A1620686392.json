                "\"The &apos;Complete Streets&apos; concept and movement in urban planning and policy has been hailed by many as a revolution that aims to challenge the auto-normative paradigm by reversing the broader effects of an urban form shaped by the logic of keeping automobiles moving. By enabling safe access for all users, Complete Streets promise to make cities more walkable and livable and at the same time more sustainable. This book problematizes the Complete Streets concept by suggesting that streets should not be thought of as merely physical spaces, but as symbolic and social spaces. When important social and symbolic narratives are missing from the discourse and practice of Complete Streets, what actually results are incomplete streets. The volume questions whether the ways in which complete streets narratives, policies, plans and efforts are envisioned and implemented might be systematically reproducing many of the urban spatial and social inequalities and injustices that have characterized cities for the last century or more. From critiques of a \"mobility bias\" rooted in the neoliberal foundations of the Complete Streets concept, to concerns about resulting environmental gentrification, the chapters in Incomplete Streets variously call for planning processes that give voice to the historically marginalized and, more broadly, that approach streets as dynamic, fluid and public social places. This interdisciplinary book is aimed at students, researchers and professionals in the fields of urban geography, environmental studies, urban planning and policy, transportation planning, and urban sociology. \"--",
                "\"The most prolific and persistent product of the unfolding vision of &apos;liveable cities&apos; and &apos;cities for people&apos; has been the genesis and growth of &apos;complete streets;&apos; a concept and movement that has exploded across the urban planning, transportation planning, environmental policy, sustainable communities, and other scenes. This book about those where important missing narratives in the complete streets discourse and practice result in streets that are \"complete\" for some but not others. It applies a critical perspective on the rhetoric and practice of complete streets that goes beyond seeing streets as merely functional spaces for moving people and objects\"--"
