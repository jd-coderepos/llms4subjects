            "abstract": "Your essential comparative approach to learning C++ and Java Programming with Objects: A Comparative Presentation of Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and Java, a comparative presentation of object-oriented programming with two of the most popular programming languages of today, teaches vital skills and techniques for the Internet age. Based on highly successful courses taught by the author, this book answers the need for a comprehensive educational program on the subject of object-oriented programming. In a clear and accessible format, the author compares and contrasts both languages, from basic language constructs to how both languages are used in application-level programming, such as graphics programming, network programming, and database programming. Since both C++ and Java were born out of the same language, C, learning these two languages together has several distinct advantages: * Because they have much in common at the level of basic language structures, learning C++ and Java together saves time and facilitates the mastery of each * Learning by contrast and comparison can be more efficient and enjoyable, allowing readers access to the strengths and weaknesses of both languages * Learning to write a program in one language that corresponds to a given program in the other language enables students to tackle more difficult projects in either language * Comparing similar concepts in the two languages leads to a deeper understanding of the concepts in both Roughly the first half of the text is devoted to basic language issues. More advanced topics are detailed in the second half, including programming of graphical user interfaces, multithreading, network programming, and database programming. Designed as a text for educational programs in advanced programming and as a reference for professionals implementing Web- and Internet-based applications, Programming with Objects: A Comparative Presentation of Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and Java is also recommended for programmers familiar with either language who wish to expand their programming skills",
