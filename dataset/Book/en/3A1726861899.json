                "This detailed new edition delves into recently developed protocols for those working on cell nucleus research, including some of the less well-explored areas of study. Like the previous editions, this book features contributions from top experts in their respective fields. Written for the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, chapters include introductions to their topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and up-to-date, The Nucleus, Third Edition will help students and postdocs become aware of vital available methodologies when planning their new projects."
