            "title": "Biodiesel from flowering plants",
            "abstract": "This book offers an exhaustive coverage of process modifications in biodiesel production from oil drawn from 84 oleaginous plant species occurring in all parts of the world, thereby enlisting the scope and potential of many new and non-conventionally obscure plant sources. Biodiesel, now prepared from major vegetable oils, has become a compulsion to offset the dwindling reserve of petro-diesel, which naturally intrudes into the cooking oil demand. This has necessitated search for new sources. The book consolidates the biodiesel production from oils being extracted from conventional plants and also from a plethora of new and non-conventional plants along with their habit and habitats, history of biodiesel’s invention, explanation on species-wise biodiesel process variables, catalytic inclusions, global standards, fuel properties varying with species, blending benefits, cost effectiveness, shelf life, ignition characteristics, fuel consumption and engine performances with eco-friendly exhaust. This book is of immense use to teachers, researchers, scientists of climatology and carbon footprint, energy consultants, fuel chemists, students of agriculture and forestry, automobile engineering, industrial chemistry, environmental sciences and policy makers or anyone who wishes to scale up the biodiesel industry.",
