Covering the latest developments to Pacejka&apos;s own industry-leading model as well as the widely-used models of other pioneers in the field, the book combines theory, guidance, discussion and insight in one comprehensive reference. While the details of individual tire models are available in technical papers published by SAE, FISITA and other automotive organizations, Tire and Vehicle Dynamics remains the only reliable collection of information on the topic and the standard go-to resource for any engineer or researcher working in the area. New edition of the definitive book on tire mechanics, by the acknowledged world authority on the topicCovers everything an automotive engineer needs to know about pneumatic tires and their impact on vehicle performance, including mathematic modelling and its practical applicationMost vehicle manufacturers use what is commonly known as Pacejka&apos;s &apos;Magic Formula&apos;, the tire model developed and presented in this book",
