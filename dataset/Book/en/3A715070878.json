                "\"Our new book &apos;Innovations in healthy and functional foods&apos; endeavors to integrate two key contemporary concepts &apos;innovation&apos; and &apos;functional and healthy foods&apos;, the major thrust in the nutrition and nutraceuticals world. This book endeavors to include topics, which have been researched in academia but have potential to be applied in food industry. A question arises in one&apos;s mind which step in the innovation process would be ideal for academia-industry collaboration. The collaboration may take place at any step in the innovation process, i.e., ideation, feasibility, development, commercialization and launch. However, we think the most ideal point is at stage zero, i.e., before even a particular project conceived. At this stage as industry scans the consumers&apos; needs and desires they can also scan the new technology, solutions and capabilities available within academia\"--",
                "\"Functional food developers are faced with challenges and opportunities in bringing these food products into the marketplace. This book addresses the latest innovation models, the regulatory framework around innovation, and social issues related to consumer perspectives on innovation versus the need for functional food products. Presented by professionals directly involved in the process, chapters cover food safety, packaging, and regulations; drivers and barriers in innovation; the marketing of functional foods globally; the changing dynamics of food consumption in developing countries; product innovation; technological development; functional food ingredients; and future trends\"--"
