Whose home and whose vision of living.",
                "\"Mies at Home is a radical rereading of one of the most significant periods in Mies van der Rohe&apos;s career, from the mid to late 1920s when he was developing his seminal spatial ideas- ideas that would culminate in his celebrated design of the Tugendhat House. The book examines how Mies&apos;s experience of residing in his apartment, doubling as a studio, in central Berlin had an impact on his thoughts about domestic architecture. It uncovers one of the most profound but virtually untold aspects of Mies&apos;s development: how his visions of an ideal lifestyle came out of his own living experience and how they, in turn, informed his spatial concepts. During this period, Mies used his domestic space flexibly to work, socialize and sleep by reconfiguring furniture to adapt to different situations. This day-to-day experience propelled him to put forward a novel formulation of spaces that were free, open, and could be readily &apos;reassigned&apos;. Beautifully illustrated throughout, Mies at Home offers a fresh investigation of the diverse intentions and strategies the architect used in creating his iconic open spaces. It will be an insightful read for researchers, academics and students in architectural history and theory\"--"
