                "\"Equal parts biographical puzzle, architectural meditation, and probing detective story, Adina Hoffman&apos;s Till We Have Built Jerusalem offers a prismatic view into one of the world&apos;s most beloved and troubled cities. Panoramic yet intimate, this portrait of three architects who helped build modern Jerusalem is also a gripping exploration of the ways in which politics and aesthetics clash in a place of constant conflict.  The book opens with the arrival in 1930s Jerusalem of the celebrated Berlin architect Erich Mendelsohn, who, as a refugee from Hitler&apos;s Germany, has to reckon with a complex new Middle Eastern reality. Next we meet Austen St. Barbe Harrison, Palestine&apos;s chief government architect from 1922 to 1937. Steeped in the traditions of Byzantine and Islamic building, he&apos;s forced to work in the often stifling and violent context of British rule. And in the riveting final section, Hoffman herself sets out through the battered streets of today&apos;s Jerusalem looking for traces of a possibly Greek, possibly Arab architect named Spyro Houris. Once renowned around town, Houris is now utterly forgotten, though his buildings still stand, a ghostly testimony to his presence. A beautifully written rumination on memory and forgetting,  place and displacement, Till We Have Built Jerusalem uncovers ramifying levels of one great city&apos;s buried history as it asks what it means, everywhere, to be foreign and to belong\"--",
                "\"A cultural history of Jerusalem under the British Mandate, focusing on the tensions between its architecture and its political divisions\"--"
