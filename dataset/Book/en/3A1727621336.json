            "abstract": "Biomedical engineering involves the application of the principles and techniques of engineering to the enhancement of medical science as applied to humans or animals. It involves an interdisciplinary approach which combines the materials, mechanics, design, modelling and problem-solving skills employed in engineering with medical and biological sciences so as to improve the health, lifestyle and quality-of-life of individuals. Biomedical engineering is a relatively new field, and involves a whole spectrum of disciplines covering: bioinformatics, medical imaging, image processing, physiological signal processing, biomechanics, biomaterials and bioengineering, systems analysis, 3-D modelling, etc. Combining these disciplines, systematically and synergistically yields total benefits which are much greater than the sum of the individual components. Prime examples of the successful application of biomedical engineering include the development and manufacture of biocompatible prostheses, medical devices, diagnostic devices and imaging equipment and pharmaceutical drugs.The purpose of this book is to present the latest research and development carried out in the areas of biomedical engineering, biomaterials and nanomaterials science and to highlight the applications of such systems. Particular emphasis is given to the convergence of nano-scale effects, as related to the delivery of enhanced biofunctionality. The contents describe a number of materials/engineering approaches that are currently being explored in order to create systems that can impart clinical benefits. They reflect many of the significant challenges to producing medical implants and therapies that are capable of achieving the regeneration of viable tissues and organs for implantation.It is intended that this volume should serve as a key reference for those who wish to contribute to the global endeavour towards improving the clinical outcomes for patients of today and tomorrow. Ahmed (Advanced Digital Manufacturing Centre, U. of Central Lancashire, UK) et al. compile 13 chapters that present recent research and development and applications in biomedical engineering, biomaterials and nanomaterials science. They emphasize the convergence of nano-scale effects and their relationship to the delivery of enhanced biofunctionality. Specific topics include health hazards of materials, the integration of microfabrication and surface functionalization strategies, the mechanics of biomimetic/biological vesicles, and engineered titanium surface promoting osseointegration. Others address electrospinning of micro and nano fibers, bioactive glasses, ordered nanoporous silica materials, materials for bone regeneration, approaches to synthesize mineral and mineral/organic materials, fluoridated hydroxyapatite coating on metallic implants, drug delivery system design, microbiological aspects of biomedical devices, and the adsorption of proteins and amino acids onto surfaces. Contributors are researchers in biomedical engineering, biology, materials science, and other fields from the US, the UK, Asia, and Israel.",
