Making extensive use of archives in the United States, England, the Netherlands, Germany, and France, Lella Rupp examines the histories and accomplishments of three major transnational women&apos;s organizations to tell the story of women&apos;s struggle to construct a feminist international collective identity. Rupp focuses on three major organizations that were, at least technically, open to all women: the broadly based and cautious International Council of Women, founded in 1888; the feminist International Alliance of Women, an offshoot of a group originally called the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, founded in 1904: and the vanguard Women&apos;s International League for Peace and Freedom, which grew out of the International Congress of Women that met at The Hague in 1915",
