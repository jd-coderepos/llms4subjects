            "abstract": [
                "\"This book will set up the foundation for the successful process of going about the IoT product design and management while offering specific practical and tried recommendations before, during, and after execution. It also offers a practical recipe for the endeavor by offering technological and human-related best practices and pitfalls based on numerous real-world examples. While high level technology, data, and business principles will be discussed, this book is not a deep technical guide that covers technological solutions in detail. Rather we cover the breadth of the technologies related to IoT at a high level. As an analogy, imagine that you are trying to design a few guided tours in 2 states in the United States. This book would be the equivalent of zooming out on the whole 50 states&apos; geographical characteristics, how the federal and state regulations apply, how the seasons work in the United States, and how tours generally fail or succeed in this country. You will be able to understand who you need to connect with and understand the interests of tour guides, hikers, caterers, state park rangers, and the wildlife regulations. You may not become a restaurant owner but you would learn enough to be able to hire them and ask them the right questions. In the opposite direction, if you are a restaurant owner and like to engage with tours you can learn about their business and be more successful at negotiating a better deal. Equivalently, the reader of this book will have a much better likelihood of a successful product design and development after applying the principles in the book. You will know what aspects will be needed, what questions to ask, where to dig more deeply, and what kind of skills set you up for success. Also if you are deep into any one of the pillars of IoT products such as product development, security, hardware, software, data science, or other related fields you will gain a valuable understanding of other skills in the ecosystem and how you can best connect with them\"--",
