                "\"The book entitled \"Biopesticides in Organic Farming : Recent Advances\", describes critically reviewed, key aspects of organic farming and provides a unique and timely science-based resource for researchers, teachers, extension workers, students, primary producers and others around the world. This book is intended to be a unique and indispensable resource that offers a diverse range of valuable information and perspectives on biopesticides in organic agriculture. It has chapters on each and every aspect related with biopesticides in organic farming which are compiled by researchers and eminent professors at various universities across the globe. The wide spectrum information in various chapters with the addition of the terms related to organic farming and concept statements is presented in very concise manner. Features: This book is designed, as per course curriculum of different universities offering courses on Organic Farming, for undergraduate and post graduate students, researchers, university professors and extension workers. The first section provides, Overview of organic farming with special reference to biopesticides followed by the Principles of the applications of biopesticides in organic farming, Impact of Environmental factors on biopesticides in organic farming, Pesticides Exposure Impacts on Health and Need of Biopesticides in Organic Farming, and Role of nutrients in the management of crop diseases through biopesticides. The next section deals with the management of various crop diseases through biopesticides of bacterial, fungal, viral, and Insect sex hormone, Natural enemies and Integrated Pest Management, Biotechnological Trends in Insect Pests Control Strategy, Challenges in the popularization of Biopesticides in organic farming, Certification process and standards of organic farming and Marketing and export potential of organic Products. Information presented in an accessible way for students, professors, researchers, business innovators and entrepreneurs, management professionals and practitioners\"--",
