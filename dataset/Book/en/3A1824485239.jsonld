            "abstract": "This edited book discusses creative and recent developments of fuzzy systems and its real-life applications of multiple criteria decision making. Keeping on the existing fuzzy sets and recent developed fuzzy sets, viz., intuitionistic fuzzy, Pythagorean fuzzy, Fermatean fuzzy, Hesitant fuzzy and multiple criteria decision approaches, this book is committed to probing the soft computing techniques and fuzzy multiple criteria decision making in favour of fuzzy intelligent system and business analytics. It also addresses novel development of fuzzy set theory as well as real-life applications of fuzzy systems. It presents challenging and useful real-world applications based on problems of decision making in various fields. The modelling and solution procedures of such real-world problems will be provided concisely although all topics start with a more developed resolution.The contributory chapters will be based on the vast research experiences of the authors in real-world decision-making problems. This book provides readers with a valuable conspectus of several decision-making problems as a reference for researchers and industrial practitioners in this field. This book will broadly cover recent development of fuzzy systems and its applications of multiple criteria decision making in the areas of management and production, manufacturing management, selections problems, group decision making, transportation and logistics, inventory control systems and interval technique/fuzzy technique (uncertainty) of the above mentioned areas",
