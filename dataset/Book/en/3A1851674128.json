            "abstract": "\"The alkaline calcareous nature, high pH, salinity, heavy metals pollution and low organic matter content of the soils in many parts of the world have diminished the soil fertility and made essential nutrients unavailable to crops. To cope with the poor availability of soil nutrients, better soil health and to feed the fast-growing world population, the farming community is using million tons of expensive chemical fertilizers in their fields for maintaining an adequate level of nutrients for crop sustainability as well as to ensure food security. In this scenario, the exploitation of biofertilizers has become paramount importance in agricultural sector for their potential role in food safety and sustainable crop production. Keeping in view, the key importance of biofertilizers, the current book examines the role of biofertilizers in sustainable management of soil and plant health under different conditions of the changing climate. Finally, it will provide a platform for scientists and academicians all over the world to promote, share, and discuss various new issues, developments, and limitations in biofertilizers, crops and beneficial microbes. Salient Features: This book mainly focuses on the role of biofertilizers in managing soils for improving higher crops and vegetables as a substitute to chemical fertilizers. Highlights the valuable information for the mechanism of action, factors affecting and limitations of biofertilizers in the wider ecosystem. Presents diversity of techniques used across plant science. Design to cater to the needs of researchers, technologists, policy makers and undergraduates and postgraduates&apos; students studying, in the field of organic agriculture, soil microbiology, soil biology, soil fertility and fertilizers. Addresses plant responses to biofertilizers\"--",
