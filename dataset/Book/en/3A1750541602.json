            "abstract": "\"Are you studying or working in academia and in need of support? Perhaps you&apos;re finding your work, study or personal life challenging or overwhelming; are experiencing bullying, harassment or abuse; or find your progress is being blocked by unfair, exploitative or precarious systems? Or perhaps you want to support a friend or colleague who&apos;s struggling? Whether your problems are big or small, Being Well in Academia provides a wealth of practical and workable solutions to help you feel stronger, safer and more connected in what has become an increasingly competitive and stressful environment. This volume uses a realistic, pragmatic and - above all - understanding approach to offer support to a diverse audience. Covering a range of issues, it includes advice on:  Ways to increase your support network, so you&apos;re not alone  Reflections and actions that encourage you to evaluate your position  Guidance if you are in a stressful, precarious, dangerous or exploitative situation  Checklists and agreements to help you identify your specific needs and accommodations  Signposting to books, websites, networks, and organisations that provide additional support  Ways to build your confidence and connections; particularly for Black, Indigenous or People of Colour; LGBTQ+; disabled or chronically sick; or other marginalised groups  Reflections on your rights, and the responsibilities academia should be meeting  Tips for being an active bystander and helping others in need of assistance  Ideas for resisting, challenging, and coping with unfair or exploitative environments  Suggestions for bringing you happiness, inspiration, motivation, courage and hope. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to address the need to stay well in academia, and will be particularly useful to those in in diverse or disadvantaged positions who currently lack institutional support or feel at risk from academia\"--",
