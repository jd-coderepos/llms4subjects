            "abstract": "\"Cybersecurity Fundamentals explains detailed concepts within computer networks and computer security in an easy-to-understand way, making it the perfect introduction to the topic. The book covers fundamental issues, using practical examples and real-world applications to give readers a rounded understanding of the subject and how it is applied. The first three chapters provide a deeper perspective on computer networks, cyber security and different types of cyber attacks that hackers choose to unleash on cyber environments. The book then goes on to cover the types of major computer malwares and cyber security attacks that shook the cyber world in the recent years, detailing the attacks and analyzing their impact on the global economy. The details of the malware codes that help the hacker initiate the hacking attacks on the networks are described fully. It then covers high-tech cyber security programs, devices and mechanism that are extensively adopted in the modern security systems. Examples of those systems include intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and security firewalls. It demonstrates how modern technologies can be used to create and manage passwords for secure data. The book also covers aspects of wireless networks and their security mechanisms. The details of the most commonly used Wi-Fi routers are provided with step by step procedures to configure and secure them more efficiently. Test questions are included throughout the chapters to ensure comprehension of the material. Along with the book&apos;s step-by-step approach, this will allow undergraduate students of cybersecurity, network security and related disciplines to gain a quick grasp of the fundamental topics in the area. No prior knowledge is needed to get the full benefit of the book\"--",
