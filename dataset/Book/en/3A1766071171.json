Bioactive constituents present in grapes and vines, mainly polyphenols, are attracting increasing interest from consumers demanding polyphenol-rich foods as a result of epidemiological evidence suggesting the protective potential of polyphenols against chronic diseases directly associated with oxidative damage, such as Alzheimer&apos;s, cancers, diabetes, and hypertension, amongst others. In this regard, besides the traditional products from grapes, such as wine and juice, grape Vitis by-products are increasingly being re-utilized and transformed into high-value products for the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. In this context, the book Vitis Products: Composition, Health Benefits and Economic Valorization intends to deeply discuss many aspects of the products derived from grapevines, including the diversity and potential of a wide range of economical possibilities, factors involved in their composition, varietal differences, and industrial process, showing a wide range of possibilities\"--",
