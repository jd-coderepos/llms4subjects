            "abstract": "\"Preface This book is an outgrowth of Classical Competing Risks (2001). I was very pleased to be encouraged by Rob Calver and Jim Zidek to write a second, expanded edition. Among other things it gives the opportunity to correct the many errors that crept into the first edition. This edition has been typed in Latex by my own fair hand, so the inevitable errors are now all down to me. The book is now divided into four sections but I won&apos;t go through describing them in detail here since the contents are listed on the next few pages. The book contains a variety of data tables together with R-code applied to them. For your convenience these can be found on the Web site at. Au: Please provideWeb site url. Survival analysis has its roots in death and disease among humans and animals, and much of the published literature reflects this. In this book, although inevitably including such data, I try to strike a more cheerful note with examples and applications of a less sombre nature. Some of the data included might be seen as a little unusual in the context, but the methodology of survival analysis extends to a wider field. Also, more prominence is given here to discrete time than is often the case. There are many excellent books in this area nowadays. In particular, I have learnt much fromLawless (2003), Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002) and Cox and Oakes (1984). More specialised works, such as Cook and Lawless (2007, for Au: Add to recurrent events), Collett (2003, for medical applications), andWolstenholme refs\"--",
