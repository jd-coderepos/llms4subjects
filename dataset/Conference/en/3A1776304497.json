The 29 papers presented in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 35 submissions. They deal with the development and dissemination of relation algebras, Kleene algebras, and similar algebraic formalisms. Topics covered range from mathematical foundations to applications as conceptual and methodological tools in computer science and beyond"
