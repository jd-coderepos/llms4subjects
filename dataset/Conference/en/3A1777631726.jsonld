            "abstract": [
                "This book contains an abundance of numerical analyses based on significant data sets, illustrating the close affiliation between intelligent solutions and future mobility. Which of the prediction models should be applied to improve road safety? How to solve selected issues with assessment of urban roundabouts? What is the future of shared mobility services? How to use spatial data in planning processes related to electromobility implementation? What is the right approach to the problem of road and rail traffic processes? This book provides you with answers to these and many other questions. With regard to the research results discussed and the selected solutions applied, the book primarily addresses the needs of three target groups: • Scientists and researchers (ITS field) • Local authorities (responsible for the transport systems at the urban and regional level) • Representatives of business (traffic strategy management) and industry (manufacturers of ITS components). The book gathers selected papers presented at the 17th “Transport Systems. Theory and Practice” Scientific and Technical Conference organised by the Department of Transport Systems, Traffic Engineering and Logistics at the Faculty of Transport and Aviation Engineering of the Silesian University of Technology. The conference was held on 20–21 September 2021 in Katowice (Poland). More details are available at www.TSTP.polsl.pl.",
