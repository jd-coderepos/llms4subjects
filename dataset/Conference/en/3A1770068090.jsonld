                "This book reports on cutting-edge findings and developments in physical, social and occupational ergonomics. It covers a broad spectrum of studies and evaluation procedures concerning physical and mental workload, work posture and ergonomic risk. Further, it reports on significant advances in the design of services and systems, including those addressing special populations, for purposes such as health, safety and education, and discusses solutions for a better and safer integration of humans, automated systems and digital technologies. The book also analyzes the impact of culture on peoples cognition and behavior, providing readers with timely insights into theories on cross-cultural decision-making, and their diverse applications for a number of purposes in businesses and societies. Based on three AHFE 2020 conferences (the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Physical Ergonomics and Human Factors, the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Social &amp; Occupational Ergonomics, and the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Cross-Cultural Decision Making), it provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the current challenges in physical, social and occupational ergonomics, including those imposed by technological developments, highlights key connections between them, and puts forward optimization strategies for sociotechnical systems, including their organizational structures, policies and processes",
