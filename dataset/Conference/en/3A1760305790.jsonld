            "abstract": "This book gathers papers on interactive and collaborative mobile learning environments, assessment, evaluation and research methods in mobile learning, mobile learning models, theory and pedagogy, open and distance mobile learning, life-long and informal learning using mobile devices, wearables and the Internet of Things, game-based learning, dynamic learning experiences, mobile systems and services for opening up education, mobile healthcare and training, case studies on mobile learning, and 5G network infrastructure. Today, interactive mobile technologies have become the core of many—if not all—fields of society. Not only do the younger generation of students expect a mobile working and learning environment, but also the new ideas, technologies and solutions introduced on a nearly daily basis also boost this trend. Discussing and assessing key trends in the mobile field were the primary aims of the 13th International Conference on Interactive Mobile Communication Technologies and Learning (IMCL2019), which was held in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 31 October to 01 November 2019. Since being founded in 2006, the conference has been devoted to new approaches in interactive mobile technologies, with a focus on learning. The IMCL conferences have since become a central forum of the exchange of new research results and relevant trends, as well as best practices. The book’s intended readership includes policymakers, academics, educators, researchers in pedagogy and learning theory, schoolteachers, further education lecturers, practitioners in the learning industry, etc.",
