                "This volume emphasizes the role of chemical education for development and, in particular, for sustainable development in Africa, by sharing experiences among specialists across the African continent and with specialists from other continents. It considers all areas and levels of chemistry education, gives specific attention to known major challenges and encourages explorations of novel approaches. The chapters in this book describe new teaching approaches, approach-explorations and in-class activities, analyse educational challenges and possible ways of addressing them and explore cross-discipline possibilities and their potential benefits for chemistry education. This makes the volume an up to date compendium for chemistry educators and educational researchers worldwide."
