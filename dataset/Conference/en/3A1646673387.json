                "Smart cards are an established security research area with a very unique pr- erty: it integrates numerous sub?elds of IT Security, which often appear sc- tered and only loosely connected. Smart card research unites them by providing a common goal: advancing the state of the art of designing and deploying small tokens to increase the security in Information Technology. CARDIS has a tradition of more than one decade, and has established itself asthepremier conferencefor researchresultsinsmartcardtechnology.As smart card research is unique, so is CARDIS; the conference successfully attracts a- demic and industrial researchers without compromising in either way. CARDIS accommodates applied research results as well as theoretical contributions that might or might not become practically relevant. The key to making such a m- ture attractive to both academia and industry is simple: quality of contributions and relevance to the overall subject. This year’s CARDIS made it easy to continue this tradition: we received 76 papers, nearly all of them relevant to the focus of CARDIS and presenting high-quality researchresults. The ProgramCommittee workedhard on selecting the best 25 papers to be presented at the conference. We are very grateful to the members of the Program Committee and the additional referees for generously spending their time on the di?cult task of assessing the value of submitted papers. Daniel Schreckling provided invaluable assistance in handling submissions, managing review reports and editing the proceedings. The assistance of Jordi Castell` a in handling practical aspects of the conference preparation is also greatly appreciated."
