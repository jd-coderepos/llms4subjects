            "abstract": "Design and implementation of service-oriented architectures impose numerous research questions from the ﬁelds of software engineering, system analysis and modeling, adaptability, and application integration. Service-oriented Systems Engineering represents a symbiosis of best practices in object orientation, component-based development, distributed computing, and business process management. It provides integration of business and IT concerns.  Service-oriented Systems Engineering denotes a current research topic in the ﬁeld of IT-Systems Engineering with high potential in academic research and industrial application. The annual Ph.D. Retreat of the Research School provides all members the opportunity to present the current state of their research and to give an outline of prospective Ph.D. projects. Due to the interdisciplinary structure of the Research School, this technical report covers a wide range of research topics. These include but are not limited to: Human Computer Interaction and Computer Vision as Service; Service-oriented Geovisualization Systems; Algorithm Engineering for Service-oriented Systems; Modeling and Veriﬁcation of Self-adaptive Service-oriented Systems; Tools and Methods for Software Engineering in Service-oriented Systems; Security Engineering of Service-based IT Systems; Service-oriented Information Systems; Evolutionary Transition of Enterprise Applications to Service Orientation; Operating System Abstractions for Service-oriented Computing; and Services Speciﬁcation, Composition, and Enactment.",
