                "Intelligent information technology has signi?cantly progressed along with the rapid growth of computer communication networks in the last decade. The - search in this domain became highly active under the worldwide growing en- ronment providing the objective study issues. The research situation in Japan is no exception in this trend. An enormous number of studies in intelligent - formation technology are presented every year in Japanese domestic conferences associated with this ?eld. Many of them are outstanding in terms of the tech- cal originality, quality and signi?cance. The annual conference of JSAI (Japan Society for Arti?cial Intelligence) is one of the key and representative domestic meetings in the ?eld of intelligent information technology. In particular, award papers in this conference have an excellent quality in international standards. TheannualconferenceofJSAIalsoorganizesco-locatedinternationalworkshops to provide excellent study reports for worldwide researchers. The objectives of this book are to present the award papers from the 19th annual conference of JSAI 2005 and the selected papers from the ?ve co-located international workshops and to promote the study exchange among worldwide researchers. Five papers received awards among more than 200 presentations in the conference, and 40 papers were selected from the workshops of Logic and Engineering of Natural Language Semantics 2005 (LENLS 2005), Learning with Logics and Logics for Learning (LLLL 2005), Agent Network Dynamics and Intelligence (ANDI 2005), Conversational Informatics (CI 2005) and Risk Management Systems with Intelligent Data Analysis (RMSIDA 2005)."
