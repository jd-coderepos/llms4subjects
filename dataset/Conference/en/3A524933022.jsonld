                "Upspeeding technological evolution and globalisation characterise today’s and future lives of engineers. It is vital for all institutions involved in engineering education to keep pace and to anticipate future needs. The herein presented collection of papers results from the Workshop on Global Engineering Education (GEE’3) which took place at Aachen University of Technology, 18 – 20 October 2000. In this meeting more than 150 specialists from 25 countries discussed the topic “Educating the Engineer for the Century”. Which role to attribute to non-technical qualifications? How to integrate ethical aspects in education? Do we have to define international standards in education? What about quality control? What is the potential of new media for knowledge transfer? How to organise lifelong learning for engineers? - These are some of the questions discussed among representatives of industries, educational institutions, politicians and individuals during this meeting. According to the sessions of the workshop, the book is subdivided into chapters covering the areas “Role of the Global Engineer in Meeting the Challenges of Society in the Century”, ”Internationality and Interdisciplinarity”, “Engineering Education in Emerging Economies”, “European Bachelor and Master Programmes”, “Developing Personal Skills to be a Global Engineer”. Three chapters deal with successful practice in engineering education covering the topics “Programmes, Curricula and Evaluation”, “Educational Concepts”, and “University-Industry Partnership, Design Projects”."
