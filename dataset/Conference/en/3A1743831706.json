                "\"This book prompts architects and anthropologists to think and act together. In order to fully grasp the relationship between human beings and their built environments and design more livable and sustainable buildings and cities in the future, we need new cross-disciplinary approaches combining anthropology and architecture. This is neither anthropology of architecture, nor ethnography for architects, but a new approach beyond these positions: Architectural Anthropology. The anthology gathers contributions from leading researchers from various Nordic universities, architectural schools and architectural firms as well as prominent international scholars like Tim Ingold, Albena Yaneva and Sarah Pink - all exploring, developing and innovating the cross-disciplinary field between anthropology and architecture. Several contributions are co-written by architects and anthropologists, merging approaches from the two disciplines in order to fully explore the dynamics of lived space. Through a broad range of empirical examples, methodological approaches and theoretical reflections, the anthology provides inspiration and tools for scholars, students and practitioners working with lived space. The first part focusses on homes, walls and boundaries, the second on urban space and public life, and the third on processes of creativity, participation and design\"--"
