                "The international Gesture Workshops have become the leading interdisciplinary events for dissemination of the latest results on gesture-based communication. The goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers who want to meet and share ideas on advanced research on gesture related to multidisciplinary scienti?c ?elds. Depending on the ?elds, the objectives can be very di?erent. While physiology and biomechanics aim to extract fundamental knowledge of physical gesture, computer sciences try to capture di?erent aspects of gesture and extract features that help to identify, interpret or rebuild the underlying mechanisms of communication gestures. Other approaches and methodologies are followed by cognitive sciences and linguistics, bringing a complementary - derstanding of motor control and gesture meaning. The results can be enhanced by technological applications or demonstrations. For example, gestural inter- tion in an augmented or virtual reality context leads to active application areas. Since 1996 gesture workshops have been held approximately every two years, with full post-proceedings usually published by Springer.",
