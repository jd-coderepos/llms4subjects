            "abstract": "The real represents to my perception the things that we cannot possibly not know, sooner or later, in one way or another&apos;, wrote Henry James in 1907. This description, riven with double negatives, hesitation, and uncertainty, encapsulates the epistemological difficulties of realism, for underlying its narrative and descriptive apparatus as an aesthetic mode lies a philosophical quandary. What grounds the &apos;real&apos; of the realist novel? What kind of perception isrequired to validate the experience of reality? How does the realist novel represent the difficulty of knowing? What comes to the fore in James&apos;s account, as in so many, is how the forms of realism are constituted by a relation to unknowing, absence, and ineffability.0Realism, Form, and Representation in the Edwardian Novel recovers a neglected literary history centred on the intricate relationship between fictional representation and philosophical commitment. It asks how-or if-we can conceptualize realist novels when the objects of their representational intentions are realities that might exist beyond what is empirically verifiable by sense data or analytically verifiable by logic, and are thus irreducible to conceptual schemes or linguisticpractices-a formulation Charlotte Jones refers to as &apos;synthetic realism&apos;.0In new readings of Edwardian novels including Conrad&apos;s Nostromo and The Secret Agent, Wells&apos;s Tono-Bungay, and Ford&apos;s The Good Soldier, this volume revises and reconsiders key elements of realist novel theory-metaphor and metonymy; character interiority; the insignificant detail; omniscient narration and free indirect discourse; causal linearity-to uncover the representational strategies by which realist writers grapple with the recalcitrance of reality as a referential anchor, and seek to give form to the force, opacity, and uncertain scope of realities that may lie beyond the material",
