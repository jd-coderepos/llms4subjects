            "abstract": "Abstract: The increasing pace of globalization over the past three decades has contributed immensely to global interconnectedness and interrelationships resulting in transnational movement of people across countries in different parts of the World. One of the concomitants of these movements is the enormous flow of remittances especially from transnational migrants in the destination countries to their countries of origin, resulting in a growing interest of researchers and development practitioners on the impact/effects these flows may have on development in the countries of origin. Thus, this study was focused on investigating the effects these remittances have on households and family members in Benin City, South-South of Nigeria. The study adopted a mixed methods research which involved the collection of empirical data from both qualitative and quantitative sources. Firstly, questionnaire was administered to a sample of 120 households each from Remittances Receiving Households and Non-Remittances Receiving Households in Benin City. This was to allow for comparison of the social development indicators and general wellbeing of both Households. Secondly, interview was conducted on 20 selected transnational migrants of Benin City origin resident in Germany. The quantitative data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 22). Thereafter, descriptive statistics such as frequency tables, graphs and contingency tables were used to present the results. The qualitative data was analyzed using Wolcot`s (1994) three models of analysis which are: description, analysis and interpretation. The findings of the study revealed that Remittances Receiving Households had better improvements in key social development indicators. The findings also revealed that a combination of altruistic and self-interest factors determines remittances flow to Benin City. The study also made some recommendations for policy and future research",
