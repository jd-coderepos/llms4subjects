            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: To act efficiently in the classroom, teachers should be able to judge the difficulty of learning tasks from a novice perspective, an important sub-skill of diagnostic competency. However, research suggests that teachers as domain experts might be prone to cognitive bias, using their specialized content knowledge as anchor when judging the difficulty of learning tasks for students. Thus, teachers might underestimate the difficulty that a learning task imposes on a novice learner. Due to an insensitivity, teachers might also underestimate the benefit that task optimization in line with Cognitive Load Theory typically has for novices. Teaching experience and familiarity with specific students, however, should have a debiasing effect, resulting in more accurate diagnostic judgments. The studies presented in this dissertation aimed at investigating pre-service and in-service teachers’ ability to judge learning tasks for students accurately. Results from study 1 provided evidence that pre-service teachers showed large overestimations of student performance and an insensitivity towards task optimization according to Cognitive Load Theory. These result could in fact be explained in terms of an anchoring effect. In study 2, it was found that teaching experience alone did not have a debiasing effect, as estimations did not differ between the pre-service and in-service teachers. Results from study 3 provided evidence that an anchoring effect was finally reduced, when teachers had to judge own students. Overestimations and an insensitivity towards task optimization were no longer evident. Study 4 shed light on teachers’ cognitive processes while judging the learning tasks of study 1 to 3. Again, no sensitivity for the instructional design of the learning tasks was found. Results suggest that pre-service and in-service teachers should be sensitized regarding potential anchoring effects and task design principles to improve the accuracy of diagnostic judgments",
