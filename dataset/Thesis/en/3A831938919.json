            "abstract": "The surface heat flow (qs) is paramount for modeling the thermal structure of the lithosphere. Changes in the qs over a distinct lithospheric unit are normally directly reflecting changes in the crustal composition and therewith the radiogenic heat budget (e.g., Rudnick et al., 1998; Förster and Förster, 2000; Mareschal and Jaupart, 2004; Perry et al., 2006; Hasterok and Chapman, 2011, and references therein) or, less usual, changes in the mantle heat flow (e.g., Pollack and Chapman, 1977). Knowledge of this physical property is therefore of great interest for both academic research and the energy industry. The present study focuses on the qs of central and southern Israel as part of the Sinai Microplate (SM). Having formed during Oligocene to Miocene rifting and break-up of the African and Arabian plates, the SM is characterized by a young and complex tectonic history. Resulting from the time thermal diffusion needs to pass through the lithosphere, on the order of several tens-of-millions of years (e.g., Fowler, 1990); qs-values of the area reflect conditions of pre-Oligocene times. The thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath the SM in general, and south-central Israel in particular, has remained poorly understood. To address this problem, the two parameters needed for the qs determination were investigated. Temperature measurements were made at ten pre-existing oil and water exploration wells, and the thermal conductivity of 240 drill core and outcrop samples was measured in the lab. The thermal conductivity is the sensitive parameter in this determination. Lab measurements were performed on both, dry and water-saturated samples, which is labor- and time-consuming. Another possibility is the measurement of thermal conductivity in dry state and the conversion to a saturated value by using mean model approaches. The availability of a voluminous and diverse dataset of thermal conductivity values in this study allowed (1) in connection with the temperature gradient to calculate new reliable qs values and to use them to model the thermal pattern of the crust in south-central Israel, prior to young tectonic events, and (2) in connection with comparable datasets, controlling the quality of different mean model approaches for indirect determination of bulk thermal conductivity (BTC) of rocks. The reliability of numerically derived BTC values appears to vary between different mean models, and is also strongly dependent upon sample lithology. Yet, correction algorithms may significantly reduce the mismatch between measured and calculated conductivity values based on the different mean models. Furthermore, the dataset allowed the derivation of lithotype-specific conversion equations to calculate the water-saturated BTC directly from data of dry-measured BTC and porosity (e.g., well log derived porosity) with no use of any mean model and thus provide a suitable tool for fast analysis of large datasets. The results of the study indicate that the qs in the study area is significantly higher than previously assumed. The new presented qs values range between 50 and 62 mW m⁻². A weak trend of decreasing heat flow can be identified from the east to the west (55-50 mW m⁻²), and an increase from the Dead Sea Basin to the south (55-62 mW m⁻²). The observed range can be explained by variation in the composition (heat production) of the upper crust, accompanied by more systematic spatial changes in its thickness. The new qs data then can be used, in conjunction with petrophysical data and information on the structure and composition of the lithosphere, to adjust a model of the pre-Oligocene thermal state of the crust in south-central Israel. The 2-D steady-state temperature model was calculated along an E-W traverse based on the DESIRE seismic profile (Mechie et al., 2009). The model comprises the entire lithosphere down to the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) involving the most recent knowledge of the lithosphere in pre-Oligocene time, i.e., prior to the onset of rifting and plume-related lithospheric thermal perturbations. The adjustment of modeled and measured qs allows conclusions about the pre-Oligocene LAB-depth. After the best fitting the most likely depth is 150 km which is consistent with estimations made in comparable regions of the Arabian Shield. It therefore comprises the first ever modelled pre-Oligocene LAB depth, and provides important clues on the thermal state of lithosphere before rifting. This, in turn, is vital for a better understanding of the (thermo)-dynamic processes associated with lithosphere extension and continental break-u",
