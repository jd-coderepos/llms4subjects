            "abstract": "In this thesis, a detailed experimental study on Plasmon-Coupled Resonance Energy Transfer mechanisms is presented. The coupling of nanoplasmonic structures with defined single molecule donor-acceptor-pairs is investigated by utilizing specifically tailored nanoparticle antennas. Taking into account the antenna’s properties, different influences on the energy transfer process are considered. In particular, the impact of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) position of the antenna in respect to the spectral overlap integral of the used donor-acceptor pair is studied. For the first time, this influence is approached by means of fluorescence measurements on a single molecule level. Hence, ensemble-averaging side effects can be excluded and a direct comparison of the results is enabled. For thorough characterization of the sample systems an optical scanning probe microscope, which is based on the principle of antenna-enhanced near-field microscopy, is used. The system was extended by several measurement modes, in order to perform time- and spectrally resolved investigations. Moreover, a dark-field illumination was integrated into the microscope to determine the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle antennas. This enables to observe plasmon hybridization effects in real-time, in dependence of a dynamically varied nanoparticle gap distance. Additionally, in a correlative approach of electron and dark-field microscopy, the influence of the nanoscale structure of a nanoparticle gap on the near- and far-field properties is studied. The experimental investigations were complemented with electromagnetical simulations of the utilized optical antennas. The presented thesis shows the modification of the energy transfer by means of the multiple plasmonic effects. Under utilization of NP-antennas with tailored optical properties, it is shown that the energy transfer can be enhanced or quenched. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the detection principle can be increased. This investigation successfully demonstrates a targeted modification of the resonance energy transfer rates and efficiencies by coupling to different types of antennas. The experimental results directly validate the recently introduced theory by George C. Schatz and co-workers, who developed the concept of the Generalized Spectral Overlap integral in order to describe the interaction of plasmonic nanostructures with RET quantum systems. Aside of a general understanding of the fundamental processes affecting the energy transfer rate, the energy transfer efficiency and the measurement accuracy, the final consequence of the obtained results is that PC-RET can substantially increase the RET-interaction range.",
