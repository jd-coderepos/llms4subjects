            "abstract": "Abstract: An increasing trend towards full silicon trackers in future high-energy physics experiments provokes the need to cover increasingly large areas with silicon detectors. Therefore, detector designs that utilize cost-effective production processes are becoming more important. At the same time, harsher radiative environments require novel technologies to build radiation hard detectors. This thesis aims to present research on cost effective CMOS detectors, as well as defect engineered silicon sensors.  &lt;br&gt;The first part of the thesis will present results of nitrogen enriched silicon. The technology has the potential to make existing detector designs more radiation hard. In the framework of the study fully processed strip detectors with sample groups consisting of oxygen and nitrogen enriched as well as pure Float-zone silicon and Magnetic Czochralski silicon were studied.  A focus were laser measurements with the Edge TCT setup.&lt;br&gt;The second part of the thesis will present reticle stitched sensors stemming from high volume CMOS production lines. They present a cheap alternative to the current sensor generation. The study contains three different strip flavors fabricated on a 150 µm wafer by LFoundry on a 150 nm process. In addition, the strip sensors have a length of up to 4 cm. A focus of the study were position dependent measurements to achieve the main goal of understanding the impact of the stitching process employed on the functionality of the sensors",
