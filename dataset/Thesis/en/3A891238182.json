            "abstract": "Binarity is an important factor affecting the evolution of a star. The fundamental properties of a star such as mass, rotation rate, magnetic field, lifetime and the end–product are strongly influenced by binary parameters and their evolution. Most of the massive stars, which undergo a supernova explosion in the end of their lives, reside in close binary systems in which the components experience mass transfer or mass loss. Therefore, during their evolution, their stellar parameters are significantly altered. This also affects the type of the supernova they experience as well as the type of their compact stellar remnants, neutron stars and black holes. By disrupting the gravitational bound of the system, the supernova leaves the companion as a runaway star which shows a high space velocity owing to its former orbital motion. The distribution of binary system mass ratios shows that the pre–supernova companion should also be a massive or an intermediate mass star. Although many massive runaway stars have been found so far, none of them could be linked to a supernova remnant or a neutron star with high accuracy. Thus, their origins are doubtful. By finding massive runaway stars which can be associated to a supernova remnant and a neutron star, firstly, the theoretical case of binary supernova ejection of a star can be proven. Secondly, the relation between the binary evolution and the observational properties of neutron stars and supernova remnants can be found. Thirdly, the effects of the binary evolution on the stellar parameters of the pre–supernova companion can be identified. Lastly, the supernova remnant parameters such as distance and age can be determined more precisely.",
