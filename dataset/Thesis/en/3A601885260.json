            "abstract": "The persistence in the different compartments and in the atmospheric long-range transportation is important property of pesticides as representatives of the semivolatile substances. These compounds could be distributed dependent on the air pressure as well as the temperature - between gas and particle phase. In an aerosol smog chamber could be simulated the atmospheric degradation of airborne substances through hydroxyl radicals. The smog-chamber was cooled on 2 and -10ʿC and the degradation kinetic of semivolatile substance (Aldrin) coated on fine quartz particles (Aerosil 380) was researched. The coated Aerosil was mixed with water in ration 1:1000 and the suspension was sprayed into the chamber. Fine agglomerates were formed during the spaying with mean diameter approximately 1 æm. The precursors for the production of hydroxyl radicals were either reacting mixtures of hydrazine and ozone in absence of light source or photolysis of methylntrite. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals was varied over two powers of ten, from approximately 5105 to 7107 cm-3. The concentration of that OHradicals was calculated over the degradation rate of hydrocarbons (n-octane, n-hexane, 2,2,3-trimthylbutane, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane). The hydrocarbons were cryofocussed in a glass-coated steel capillary at -110ʿC (using liquid nitrogen and a magnetic valve to control the flow) and analyzed gas chromatographically ...",
