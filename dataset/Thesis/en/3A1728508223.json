            "abstract": "NADPH is an essential cofactor that drives biosynthetic reactions in all living organisms. It is a reducing agent and thus electron donor of anabolic reactions that produce major cellular components as well as many products in biotechnology. Indeed, the engineering of metabolic pathways for the production of many products is often limited by the availability of NADPH. One common strategy to address this issue is to swap cofactor specificity from NADH to NADPH of enzymes. However, this process is time consuming and challenging because multiple parameters need to be engineered in parallel. Therefore, the first aim of this project is to establish an efficient metabolic biosensor to select enzymes that can reduce NADP+. An NADPH auxotroph strain was constructed by deleting major reactions involved in NADPH biosynthesis in E. coli’s central carbon metabolism with the exception of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. To validate this strain, two enzymes were tested in the presence of several carbon sources: a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase ...",
