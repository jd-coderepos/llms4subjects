                "In this work, spatial distributions for reactive stable and transient species that are involved in the reaction cycle of H2O2, a key species for biomedical applications, were determined directly in the effluent of a kINPen-sci plasma jet. The small diameter of cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets and their operation at atmospheric pressure that causes strong quenching reactions make diagnostics challenging. Here, various diagnostic techniques have been employed and adapted for the use in the effluent of a cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet, which were laser atomic absorption spectroscopy (LAAS) at 811.5 nm for the detection of Ar(3P2), picosecond two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (ps-TALIF) at 225 nm and 205 nm for the detection of O and H atoms, respectively, and continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) at 1.506 µm for the detection of HO2, and cw-CRDS at 8000 µm for the detection of H2O2. All these methods provide absolute number densities. In this work, spatial distributions within the small diameter of the effluent of a CAPJ were obtained, which have not been reported so far literature. In order to overcome the line-of-sight limitations of CRDS, radial scans were performed and transformed into a spatial distribution by using Abel inversion. Based on the determined spatial density distributions for H atoms, O atoms, HO2 radicals, and H2O2 molecules, together with the investigated impact of humidity in the feed gas on the ..."
