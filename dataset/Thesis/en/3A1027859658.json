            "abstract": "Abstract: The vast majority of advanced metastatic disease is currently incurable. Consequently, metastasis is responsible for over 90% of the almost 9 million cancer related yearly deaths worldwide. In the pursuit of therapies aiming to inhibit metastasis, a detailed understanding of the different metastatic processes is of vital importance. Studies of detached tumor cells have described microtubule-based cellular protrusions called microtentacles with possible metastatic implications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, we report that the formation of tumor cell microtentacles depends on the&lt;br&gt;presence and dynamics of small GTPases of the septin family, which are part of the cytoskeleton. In matrix-attached breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer cells, septins are associated with the cytosolic actin cytoskeleton. Detachment of cells causes redistribution of septins to the membrane, where microtentacle formation occurs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The small GTPase Cdc42 and its effector proteins Borg regulate septins and are essential for microtentacle formation. We observed a close association of Borg with the septin cytoskeleton, both in attached and detached breast cancer cells. Additionally, we show that dominant active and negative Cdc42 inhibit microtentacle formation indicating that the free cycling of Cdc42 between its active and inactive state is essential for septin regulation and microtentacle formation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, inhibition of septins using forchlorfenuron in cell attachment and&lt;br&gt;aggregation models suggest that septins play an essential role in the metastatic&lt;br&gt;behavior of tumor cells, possibly attributed to a decrease in microtentacle formation. Our data propose septins as promising targets for novel anti-metastatic therapies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using a recombinant human septin complex, we induced septin filament&lt;br&gt;formation in vitro, and suggest a method to identify septin filament-binding proteins. Such studies could give new insight into the roles of septins in microtentacle formation and septin biology in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last, by highlighting important structural and functional similarities, we reason&lt;br&gt;that toxin-induced protrusions serve as a potent experimental model for&lt;br&gt;microtentacles",
