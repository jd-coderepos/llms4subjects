            "abstract": "Abstract: Protein microarrays are essential tools for high-throughput proteome interaction and binding kinetics analysis. Recent technical developments have resulted in approaches for the generation of protein arrays by in situ cell-free expression of DNA array templates. We combined and enhanced these ideas by creating innovative microfluidic flow cells in standard microscope slide format and such improved system efficiency, operability, robustness and controllability. Two of these flow cell designs proved to be most suitable, the booklet design and the structured PDMS slide design. Both incorporate the idea of having a highly parallel microfluidic gap of ~ 30 μm between a template DNA microarray and a protein capture surface. The in situ protein expression is initiated by priming the microfluidic gap with ~ 20 μl of cell-free protein expression mix, after an incubation of 30 to 90 minutes at a temperature of ~ 37 °C the protein microarray is created. Despite free diffusion of the proteins they mainly immobilize highly specific by fusion-tag as rather sharp-edged spots opposite of their DNA spot origin, such creating a protein image of the DNA array. Compared to the most advanced cell-free in situ protein microarray generation technique DAPA, we obtained protein copies of similar quality however, the system robustness could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the microfluidic system decreases the consumption of the rather expensive cell-free system to one-fifth and cut down the copy process time to half. Our new system yields easy and quick operability with slide exchange times of 1-2 minutes versus &gt; 10 minutes for DAPA.&lt;br&gt;After a first proof-of-concept for the in situ expression of protein microarrays in our newly devised microfluidic flow cells, an automated setup suitable for both the in situ expression as well as the interaction analysis of protein microarrays by flow-injection was designed, built and evaluated. The reflecto-interferometric principle patented by Biametrics GmbH, Tübingen, Germany, was selected to enable a label-free imaging detection. Such, major deficiencies of most prominent methods for imaging label-free interaction analyses could be circumvented: sensitivity of SPR against temperature drifts and plasmon crosstalk; low number of parallel measurements (&lt; 384) typical for imaging surface plasmon resonance (SPRi), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) or bio-layer interference (BLI). Aside label-free detection the automated sys ...",
