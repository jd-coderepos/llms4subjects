            "abstract": "Abstract: Apoptosis is a conserved mechanism of metazoans that does not only eliminate damaged or defective cells and serves to maintain homeostasis in an organism, but it is also initiated as a response to viral infection. However, the signals from the recognition of viruses to apoptosis of an infected cell and the host factors that regulate this cell death are not completely understood. In this study we illustrate the participation of the Bcl-2-like proteins Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 in virus infection – both two major anti-apoptotic proteins of the host cell that are crucial for cell survival. When epithelial cells and fibroblasts were infected with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), the protein levels of Mcl-1 decreased, in contrast to its mRNA levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation or enhanced degradation. Additionally, we were able to show that the protein could be replaced functionally by the viral anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein F1L upon ABT-737-induced apoptosis in MEFs and upon knockdown or inhibition of Mcl-1 in HeLa. When cells were infected with vaccinia virus (VACV), which also expresses F1L, similar results were obtained. Protein levels of Mcl-1 were not reduced after infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), but ABT-737-induced apoptosis was also inhibited by a Mcl-1-like activity.&lt;br&gt;Murine macrophages were infected with MVA, VACV, MCMV and influenza A virus, and in contrast to epithelial cells or fibroblasts, infection resulted in apoptosis. Mcl-1 deficient macrophages showed no difference in apoptosis induction compared to wild type upon infection with MVA, VACV or MCMV, whereas Bcl-XL deficiency or treatment with ABT-737 substantially increased cell death in infected cells. Additionally, absence of Bcl-XL or ABT-737 treatment reduced the generation of infectious VACV particles. These data indicate that regulation of pro-apoptotic signals during infection with different large DNA viruses does not depend on Mcl-1. In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, Mcl-1 can be functionally replaced by viral proteins such as F1L, whereas in macrophages the induction of apoptosis upon viral infection seems not be blocked by Mcl-1. In contrast, Bcl-XL is important for the survival of the virus-infected macrophage and its presence can determine the outcome of the infection since it influences the production of viral particles.&lt;br&gt;Since the viral protein F1L has critical functions of preventing apoptosis, its regulation and interaction with  ...",
