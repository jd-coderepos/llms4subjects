                "The aims of this study were to quantify the key mineralization processes and the resulting nutrient release potentials of different sediment types, their ranges of extent and dependency on varying environmental conditions such as seasonal variations or shifts in oxygen availability. Benthic phosphate fluxes and flux potentials were of particular interest as P is an essential nutrient for algal growth in marine systems and phosphate is often limiting primary production, hence strongly promotes the production of new biomass. A major P source in marine environments are mineralization products of early diagenetic processes. To gain insight into the pathways of organic matter mineralization and subsequent secondary reactions, key reactants in the solid and the dissolved phase were considered in typical sediments of the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Seven study sites in the German Baltic Sea region, representative of the major depositional environments, including coarse and fine grained sediments, both rich or poor in organic carbon, were intensively studied. The investigations were conducted on a seasonal basis during ten ship-based expeditions between July 2013 and March 2016, covering spring- and autumn algal blooms, stagnation periods with bottom water hypoxia and winter dormancy. Hypoxic conditions frequently developed in the bottom waters of the Bay of Mecklenburg, Stoltera and the Arkona Basin sites, shallower stations like the Tromper Wiek, the Oder Bank and the Darss Sill ..."
