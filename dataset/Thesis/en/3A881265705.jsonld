            "abstract": "...The main contribution of this work is an approach that allows the object-oriented modeling and coordination of mobile robots, supporting the cooperation of mobile manipulators. Within a mobile manipulator, the approach allows to define real-time reactions to sensor data and to synchronize the different actuators and sensors present, allowing sensor-aware combinations of motions for platform and arm. Moreover, the approach facilitates an easy way of programming, provides means to handle kinematic restrictions or redundancy, and supports advanced capabilities such as impedance control to mitigate position uncertainty. Working with multiple independent mobile robots, each has a different knowledge about its environment, based on the available sensors. These different views are modeled, allowing consistent coordination of robots in applications using the data available on each robot. To cope with geometric uncertainty, sensors are modeled and the relationship between their measurements and geometric aspects is defined. Based on these definitions and incoming sensor data, position estimates are automatically derived. Additionally, the more dynamic environment leads to different possible outcomes of task execution. These are explicitly modeled and can be used to define reactive behavior. The approach was successfully evaluated based on two application examples, ranging from physical interaction between two mobile manipulators handing over a work-piece to gesture control of a quadcopter for carrying goods.",
