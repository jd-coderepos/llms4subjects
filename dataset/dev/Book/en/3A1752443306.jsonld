Various chapters in this book are written by eminent scientists and prominent researchers in the field of nanotechnology across the world. This book is focused to put emerging techniques forward using nanoparticles for safe and nutritional food production, protecting crops from pests, increasing nutritional value and providing solutions for various environmental issues. The outcome of this book creates a path for wide usage of nanoparticles in food, agriculture and the environment fields. This book has clear and simple illustrations, tables and case studies to understand the content even by non-experts. This book especially deals with the nanotechnology for controlling plant pathogens, food packaging and preservation, agricultural productivity, waste water treatment and bioenergy production. Hence, this book can be adopted and used by many researchers and academicians in the fields of food, agriculture, environment and nanotechnology for catering the needs of sustainable future. The salient features of this book are \u2022 Describes nanotechnology as an interdisciplinary and emerging field in life sciences \u2022 Useful for researchers in the cutting edge life science related fields of nanoscience, nanobiology and nanotechnology \u2022 Deal with various problems in food, agriculture and environmental sector for sustainable solutions through the application of nanotechnology \u2022 Supported with illustrations in color, tables and case studies (wherever applicable), and \u2022 Contributed and well written by nanotechnology experts from across various disciplines.",
