            "abstract": "Due to the significant number of immigrants in Europe, especially Germany, integration is an ongoing subject of debate. Since the 1970s, with the emergence of the discussions on ‘place,’ it has also been realized that the immigrant experience is associated with location. Nevertheless, due to the challenges in capturing the place and migration relevance, there is a gap in understanding the role of the migrant’s geography of experiences and its outcomes (Phillips &amp; Robinson, 2015).  This research aims to investigate the extent to which both the process of objective integration and the socio-spatial practices of high-skilled Iranian immigrants in Berlin outline and influence their sense of belonging to Berlin as the new “home.” The embedded mixed-method design had employed for this study. The quantitative analysis through Pearson’s correlation technique measured the strength of the association between Iranians’ settlement distribution and the characteristics of Berlins’ districts. The quantitative analysis provides contextual data to get a greater level of understanding of the case study’s interaction with place. The units of place intend to demonstrate the case study’s presence and possible interaction with places around their settlement location that relatively shapes their perception. The qualitative analysis comprises ethnographic fieldwork and semi-structured in-depth interviews with a homogeneous sample of Iranian immigrants in Berlin that provide data on individual and ethnic behaviors and trajectories and analyze the complex interactions between the immigrant’s experience and the role of place.  This research uncovers that Iranian highly skilled immigrants are successful in integrating objectively; However, in regards to their state of belonging, it illustrated the following: The role of socio-ethnic culture of the case study in denotation of home and belonging; Iranian high-skilled immigrants’ efforts towards reaching a level of upward mobility overshadow their attempt to shape social and spatial interaction with Berliners and Berlin itself, which manifests both in their perception and use of urban space; and finally, the identification practice and the boundary-making as an act of reassurance and self-protection against the generalization of adjacent nationalities, demonstrated in the intersection of demographical settlement distribution of Iranians in Berlin and the ethnic diversity, impact the sense of belonging and place-making.",
