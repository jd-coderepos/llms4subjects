                "This thesis delves into some very important scientific challenges for the stellarator concept as a whole and W7-X in particular, namely, how one effectively interfaces the hot plasma with the material walls of the experiment, in special how the plasma heat and particle fluxes are controlled. The fundamental concept that will be used in W7-X for particle and heat exhaust is the island divertor. A number of theoretical and numerical studies have been performed to guide the design of the divertor components. The actual divertor components are in series production at this time, and are largely compatible with the expected heat loads. However, with the sophisticated codes now available, it has become clear that there are some, otherwise very attractive, operational scenarios that could lead to overloading of the W7-X divertors. At least one mitigation strategy was proposed but was until now not analyzed in sufficient detail. In this thesis, state-of-the-art codes are used to analyze this previously proposed mitigation strategy; they are also used to develop several alternative mitigation schemes, which may in the end be advantageous. The work performed here shows not only that it is conceivable to solve this already identified problem in new and arguably better ways but also that the W7-X coil set has enough degrees of freedom that many important long-pulse plasma effects can be effectively mimicked in short-pulse operation. This opens up a rich research program in the early ...",
