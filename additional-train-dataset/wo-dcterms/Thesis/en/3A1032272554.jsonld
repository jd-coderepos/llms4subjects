            "abstract": "Abstract: Apoptosis by growth factor withdrawal is induced by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. This process is directly regulated by the Bcl-2 protein family members. It had been established previously that IL-3 withdrawal induced cell death of IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 or FL5.12 cells required the activity of the kinase GSK-3. One of the targets of GSK-3 is the pro-survival Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1, which is subjected to proteasomal degradation once it has been phosphorylated by GSK-3. However, the GSK-3 dependent regulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and their regulators is poorly understood.&lt;br&gt;Employing CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout, this thesis aimed at identifying pro-apoptotic GSK-3 regulated factors. Knockout of the BH3-only proteins Puma or Bim showed that the induction of Puma, but not Bim, was crucial for apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal. As the induction of Puma mRNA was also dependent on GSK-3 activity, this thesis further aimed at identifying the GSK-3 dependent Puma regulator at transcriptional level. Loss of Foxo3a or loss of p53 reduced the induction of Puma and apoptosis upon growth factor withdrawal, with a larger effect for Foxo3a. Loss of Foxo3a and p53 together completely repressed the transcriptional induction of Puma. Thus, both transcription factors contribute to IL-3 withdrawal induced apoptosis with a major role for Foxo3a.&lt;br&gt;It has been shown that the ability of p53 to induce Puma greatly depends on the activity of GSK-3 as GSK-3 phosphorylates the histone acetyltransferase KAT5 which in turn acetylates p53, enabling it to induce Puma. Similarly, Foxo3a requires GSK-3 for full transcriptional activity. The results described here demonstrate that a constitutively active mutant of Foxo3a, which cannot be controlled by Akt directly, still requires active GSK-3 for the full transcriptional induction of Puma and cell death upon IL-3 withdrawal. Thus, the suppression of GSK-3 is a key function of PI3K signaling in order to prevent the induction of Puma and apoptosis upon growth factor withdrawal. Conversely, the activity of GSK-3 is crucial for the transcriptional activity of Foxo3a and p53, the two Puma inducers",
