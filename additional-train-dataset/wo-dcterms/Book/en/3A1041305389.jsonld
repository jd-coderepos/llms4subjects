                "\"The threat of ecological collapse is a possibility that is increasingly becoming a reality for the world&apos;s populations, both human and nonhuman. Addressing this global challenge will require enormous cultural creativity and demand a diversity of perspectives, especially those that deal with religion and the human sciences. Toward this end, this volume draws from a variety of academic disciplines and positions to explore the role and nature of environmental responsibility, especially where these intersect with religious or theological viewpoints. The disciplines, including history, philosophy, literature, politics, peace studies, economics, women&apos;s studies, and the ecological sciences, to name a few, have begun to develop distinct perspectives on the urgent ecological issues of our day, as well as pointing toward specific practices at the local and global level. This volume provides a multidisciplinary point of departure for conversations on environmental responsibility that resist simplistic solutions but rather highlight the complex nature of the ecological issues and provide conversations about potential ways forward in what appears to be an intractable global problem of huge complexity.\"--"
