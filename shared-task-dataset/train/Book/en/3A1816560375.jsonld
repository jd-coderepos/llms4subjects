            "abstract": "\"With the rapid urbanization & industrialization the amount of waste being generated every year is raising in exponential manner. Every year more than 5 billion metric tons of ago waste is being generated worldwide. In India itself an exceedingly high amount (more than 960 million tons) of solid wastes is generated every year in the form of byproducts of various processes including agricultural, mining, municipal and industrial activities. Apart from these solid wastes huge volumes liquid waste is also being generated in the form of wastewaters from different industries. These wastes are either disposed in open or in natural aquatic resources; thus, are posing severe health hazards to humans as well as to aquatic life. Thus, a meaningful and sustainable strategy to deal with these stockpiling wastes can be utilizing them as alternatives to costlier raw materials for production of valuable products. This book provides in depth information on different forms of solid and liquid wastes originating as a result of various agricultural, domestic and industrial activities, current strategies available for solid and liquid waste management in both developing and developed countries along with emerging technologies for waste management, opportunities and challenges for utilizing waste to produce valuable products for sustainable development. Major emphasis has been laid on strategies for utilizing wastes as alternates to high-cost raw materials for making valuable products of commercial utility\"--",
