                "We have, in recent decades, been able to witness a veritable revolution in the world economy, known as 'globalization'. Generally, the term is connected to the rapid increase of the free movement of goods, capital, people, ideas, information and knowledge around the globe. This book contributes to the meso- and micro-economic literature on innovation and entrepreneurship in the global economy. Extending our understanding of the many different ways that innovation and entrepreneurship contribute to economic development and growth in a globalized economy, the expert contributors highlight that the current wave of globalization has been a period of exceptional entrepreneurship both among large multinational firms and among independent entrepreneurs. They demonstrate that location matters for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, and clarify that public policy in a globalized economy must stress knowledge and ideas as the source of competitiveness and economic growth. Both graduates and post graduates, along with university researchers, will find this book to be useful in their studies, particularly those with an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship research, regional economics, economic geography and international economics",
