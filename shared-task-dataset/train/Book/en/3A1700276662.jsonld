            "abstract": "\"This volume, Natural Language Processing in Artificial Intelligence, focuses on natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and allied areas. The book delves into natural language processing, which enables communication between people and computers and automatic translation to facilitate easy interaction with others around the world. It discusses theoretical work and advanced applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information and how it presented by language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways). It looks at intelligent natural language processing and related models of thought, mental states, reasoning, and other cognitive processes. It explores the difficult problems and challenges related to partiality, under specification, and context-dependency, which are signature features of information in nature and natural languages. Key features: Addresses the functional frameworks and workflow that are trending in NLP and AI Explores basic and high level concepts, thus serving as a resource for those in the industry while also helping beginners to understand both basic and advanced aspects Looks at the latest technologies and the major challenges, issues, and advances in NLP and AI Explores an intelligent field monitoring and automated system through AI with NLP and its implications for the real world Discusses data acquisition and presents a real-time case study with illustrations related to data-intensive technologies in AI and NLP Topics include the process of business intelligence and how this platform is used, the concepts of Information retrieval systems, the neural machine translation (NMT) process, the choice of words and text in natural language processing, embedded traffic control and management systems, a technique for generating ontology by adopting the fruit fly optimization algorithm, POS labeling using the Viterbi algorithm, how natural language processing techniques can be used to prevent phishing attacks, and more. This volume will be a useful and informative resource for faculty, advanced-level students, and professionals in the field of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and other areas\"--",
