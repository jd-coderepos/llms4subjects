            "abstract": "The continuing demand for technological advances while dealing with mutual constraining characteristics of digital systems as for instance lower feature size, lower power consumption, and lower compute latency drives a need for constant innovation. To further improve state-of-the-art digital hardware, thorough knowledge of computer arithmetic is needed. This thesis explores selected aspects of the design and evaluation of computer arithmetic based on carry-save and signed-digit redundant number representations to reduce the area, the critical path latency, and the power consumption of arithmetic circuits. Carry-save arithmetic is frequently used to realize basic arithmetic operations requiring inner product calculations, as multiplication, multiply-add, multiply-accumulate, and digital filters. This thesis enhances multiplication and multiply-accumulation based on carry-save arithmetic by improving the well known Wallace and Dadda partial product reduction strategies. An alternative concept of time-based reduction strategies is introduced as well and applied to multiply-accumulate units resulting in reduced area, critical path latency, and power consumption. A competitive redundant number representation is the signed-digit number representation. Not frequently implemented in state-of-the-art hardware designs, it is recurring in prototype development. Implemented signed-digit arithmetic is based on signed-binary adder cells. This thesis demonstrates the need for optimizing these cells and presents concepts of a systematic design space exploration of signed-binary adder cells. Additionally, the error resilience capabilities of signed-digit arithmetic is evaluated and favorable digit encoding schemes are presented.",
