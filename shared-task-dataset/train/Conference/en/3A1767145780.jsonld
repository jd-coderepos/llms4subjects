            "abstract": "This book is concerned with human factors and ergonomics research and developments in the design and use of systems and devices for effective and safe healthcare delivery. It reports on approaches for improving healthcare devices so that they better fit to people\u2019s, including special population\u2019s needs. It also covers assistive devices aimed at reducing occupational risks of health professionals as well as innovative strategies for error reduction, and more effective training and education methods for healthcare workers and professionals. Equal emphasis is given to digital technologies and to physical, cognitive and organizational aspects, which are considered in an integrated manner, so as to facilitate a systemic approach for improving the quality and safety of healthcare service. The book also includes a special section dedicated to innovative strategies for assisting caregivers\u2019, patients\u2019, and people\u2019s needs during pandemic. Based on papers presented at the AHFE 2021 Conference on Human Factors and Ergonomics in Healthcare and Medical Devices, held virtually on 25\u201329 July, 2021, from USA, the book offers a timely reference guide to both researchers and healthcare professionals involved in the design of medical systems and managing healthcare settings, as well as to healthcare counselors and global health organizations. .",
