                "Are you ready for a Photoshop book that breaks all the rules? Updated for Adobe Photoshop CS3, this top-selling book breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers that's rare--it cuts through the bull and shows readers exactly \"how to do it.\" It's not a bunch of theory; it doesn't challenge readers to come up with their own settings or figure it out on their own. Instead, it shows them, step by step, the exact techniques used by today's cutting-edge digital photographers and retouchers, and it does something that virtually no other Photoshop book has ever done--it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. Including coverage of all the newest features of CS3--such as nondestructive Smart Filters, Vanishing Point with Adustable Perspective Planes, Automatic Layer Alignment and Blending, and a streamlined interface--The Photoshop CS3 Book for Digital Photographers is full-color, graphically rich, and contains project-based examples of every key step in the digital photography editing process.",
