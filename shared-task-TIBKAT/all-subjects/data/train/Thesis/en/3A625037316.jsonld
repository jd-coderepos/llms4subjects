            "abstract": "In this exposition we deal with sufficient optimality conditions of nonsmooth optimal control problems. We consider optimal control problems with ordinary differential equations. Since the integrand of the objective function and the right hand side of the state equation may contain discontinuities, we investigate nonsmooth problems. We choose different dynamics depending on the sign of a switching function. First we take a look at optimal control problems with free final time. Then we formulate sufficient conditions for problems with finitely many switching times in the regular and in the singular case. Furthermore, we investigate a class of problems with free control subarcs. Here, the influence of some control components vanish on subintervals. With the application of a multiprocess technique we develop new sufficient optimality conditions. By telescoping, we transform the nonsmooth problem into a smooth optimal control problem. We then apply existing sufficient optimality conditions. A transformation back to the original problem leads to the desired conditions. On the one hand, we apply sufficient conditions formulated by Mangasarian. On the other hand we use the theory developed by Maurer and Pickenhain. Thus we obtain a matrix riccati differential equation with additional boundary and jump conditions. By means of some examples, we discuss the application and difficulties of the here developed sufficient conditions. We show sufficient optimality conditions for the time minimal ReEntry Problem. We investigate a problem with diode and a navigation problem for the nonsmooth class. Two examples are given with free control subarc. We could not show sufficient conditions for the Earth-Mars Orbit Transfer Problem yet. For nonsmooth optimal control problems with small dimensions the here developed sufficient optimality conditions lead to good results.",
