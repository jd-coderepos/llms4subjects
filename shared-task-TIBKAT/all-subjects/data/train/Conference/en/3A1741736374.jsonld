The included research works deal with estimated models and give resolutions to complex real-life issues. In the field of evolutionary computing and other domains of applications, such as, data mining and fuzzy logic, soft computing techniques play an incomparable role, where it successfully handles contemporary computationally intensive and complex problems that have usually appeared to be inflexible to traditional mathematical methods. Comprising the concepts and applications of soft computing with other emerging research domains, this book cherishes varieties of modern applications in the fields of natural language processing, image processing, biomedical engineering, communication, control systems, circuit design etc. ."
