                "\"With more than 15 billion Wi-Fi enabled devices, Wi-Fi has proven itself as a technology that has successfully evolved over the past 25 years. The need for high-speed connectivity is growing, as Wi-Fi has evolved into a fundamental utility that is expected to be available everywhere. This comprehensive resource covers six generations of Wi-Fi standards including protocol, implementation, and network deployment for both residential and enterprise environments. It will provide readers with a new understanding of how to approach and debug basic Wi-Fi problems, and will grant those wondering whether to pick 5G or Wi-Fi 6 for their product the clarity needed to make an informed decision.  Readers will find in-depth coverage of Wi-Fi encryption and authentication methods, including explorations of recently uncovered security vulnerabilities and how to fix them. This book also provides detailed information on the implementation of Wi-Fi, including common regulatory and certification requirements, as well its associated challenges. This book also provides direction on the placement of Wi-Fi access points in indoor locations. It introduces the most recent Wi-Fi 6E certification, which defines requirements for devices operating on the newly opened 6 GHz band. Wi-Fi 6 is then compared with 5G technology, and this resource provides insight into the benefits of each as well as how these two technologies can be used to complement each other.\" --"
