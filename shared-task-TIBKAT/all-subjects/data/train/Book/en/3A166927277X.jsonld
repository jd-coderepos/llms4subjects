            "abstract": "A reliable and focused treatment of the emergent technology of fifth generation (5G) networks This book provides an understanding of the most recent developments in 5G, from both theoretical and industrial perspectives. It identifies and discusses technical challenges and recent results related to improving capacity and spectral efficiency on the radio interface side, and operations management on the core network side. It covers both existing network technologies and those currently in development in three major areas of 5G: spectrum extension, spatial spectrum utilization, and core network and network topology management. It explores new spectrum opportunities; the capability of radio access technology; and the operation of network infrastructure and heterogeneous Qoe provisioning. 5G Networks: Fundamental Requirements, Enabling Technologies, and Operations Management is split into five sections: Physical Layer for 5G Radio Interface Technologies; Radio Access Technology for 5G Networks; 5G Network Interworking and Core Network Advancements; Vertical 5G Applications; and R&D and 5G Standardization. It starts by introducing emerging technologies in 5G software, hardware, and management aspects before moving on to cover waveform design for 5G and beyond; code design for multi-user MIMO; network slicing for 5G networks; machine type communication in the 5G era; provisioning unlicensed LAA interface for smart grid applications; moving toward all-IT 5G end-to-end infrastructure; and more. This valuable resource: -Provides a comprehensive reference for all layers of 5G networks -Focuses on fundamental issues in an easy language that is understandable by a wide audience -Includes both beginner and advanced examples at the end of each section -Features sections on major open research challenges 5G Networks: Fundamental Requirements, Enabling Technologies, and Operations Management is an excellent book for graduate students, academic researchers, and industry professionals, involved in 5G technology",
