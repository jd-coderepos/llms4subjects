            "abstract": "\"A stunningly photographed guide to designing and styling the most used and important room in the home, The deVOL Kitchen showcases the fundamentals of the brand's iconic values, design principles, and now widely recognized kitchen styling, as seen in their TV show, For the Love of Kitchens. This book shares their backstory, the kitchens they've designed, and their overall philosophy when it comes to styling a kitchen, or any room in the house. Founder Paul O'Leary, Creative Director Helen Parker, and Managing Director Robin McLellan encourage you to throw out the conventional rule book, draw your own plans, and incorporate fitted and existing free-standing furniture and found objects to create a beautiful, unique room that is perfectly suited for your needs. From total rebuilds to a more modest sink and cupboard upgrade, the full-color photos throughout show how to design the space available to create a unique and stylish kitchen, whatever the budget. You'll also find tips and design ideas on how to reorganize or elevate your current kitchen using a luxurious countertop, a decorated cupboard, or a simple piece of furniture to effortlessly style up for glamor or down for simplicity. Paul, deVol's founder, details the Georgian, Victorian, and twentieth-century kitchens, houses, and styling that have inspired their four iconic ranges: The Real Shaker, The Classic English, The Sebastian Cox, and the Haberdasher's Kitchens. With chapters on the woodwork, ceramic, and metal designs and a styling and decorating guide, this book is for those wanting inspiration for their own kitchen redesign and for anyone who loves great design, beautiful styling, and impressive craftmanship\"--",
