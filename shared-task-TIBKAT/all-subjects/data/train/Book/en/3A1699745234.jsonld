            "abstract": "\"Containing some of the most recent and original studies on parking regulation and management from different disciplines, this book offers rigorous analysis from top researchers of this field of research with a clear intention to deliver policy implications and to provide information to the public The book is organized according to a variety of key topics. Among others, it covers the interaction of parking with other modes of transportation and its demand, its pricing and external effects, the role of information and digitalization, and the effects of regulation and its enforcement. It offers rigorous analyses from top researchers of this field of research with a clear intention to deliver policy implications and to provide information to the public on the important role of parking for cities. Also, it includes the view from practitioners, who discuss the present and the future of parking in cities and the future of its management. Written primarily for scholars interested in transportation, mobility, planning and urban affairs, this book is also directly relevant to practitioners and policy-makers in government with responsibilities in mobility. Additionally, the book will be of interest to the private sector as it offers a practical link between rigorous academic analyses and the needs of practitioners\"--",
