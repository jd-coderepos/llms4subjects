            "abstract": "This book presents theoretical, technical, and practical information on the modernization of future energy networks. All the basic requirements covering concepts, modeling, optimizing, and analyzing of future energy grids with various energy carriers such as electricity, gas, heat, and water, as well as their markets and contracts, are explained in detail. The main focus of the book is on modernizing both the energy consumers and the energy producers and analyzing various aspects of grid modernization such as reliability, resiliency, stability, and security. Coverage includes advanced communication protocols and solution methods for the Internet of Energy (IoE) infrastructure and energy trading in future energy grids with high/full share of renewable energy resources (RERs) within the transactive energy (TE) paradigm. Probabilistic modeling and optimizing of modern grids will be evaluated using realistic case studies considering the economic aspects of multi-carrier energy markets. This book will be welcomed as an important resource by researchers and postgraduate students studying energy systems, as well as practicing engineers working on modernizing energy grids and the design, planning, scheduling, and operation of smart power systems. Proposes practical solutions for solving the challenges of modern multi-carrier energy grids; Examines various types of energy storage systems and distributed energy resources (DERs) with an emphasis on renewable energy resources (RERs); Provides comprehensive mathematical models for optimizing of future modern multi-carrier energy grids.",
