            "abstract": "\"Chemical process industries play a pivotal role for each country; as a country's economy depends on the vitality of its chemical process industries. Increased job opportunities in the field are anticipated globally. Chemicals have also become an essential part of daily life. We cannot imagine our lives without chemicals, as they are ubiquitous. Present book emphasizes the chemical processes of several industries. This book comprises the sources, collection, purification and extraction of different chemicals from natural material like petroleum, coal, and ore from the Earth. It includes manufacturing details of C1 to C4 and aromatic compounds obtained from natural materials. It also covers the chemical process of several industries like dye, pigment, drug, pharmaceutical, fermentation, agrochemical, explosive, polymer, Period - II chemicals, Period - III chemicals, sugar, coating, starch, soap, detergent, paper, pulp, glass and cement industries. A brief introduction of each industry is described. Traditional, as well as new chemicals are discussed in this book. It also includes general knowledge of chemicals, properties, manufacturing process (such as raw materials, chemical reactions, quantitative requirement, flow sheet diagram, and procedure) and its uses. The book is especially prepared for quantitative requirement and flow sheet diagrams, which are directly collected from industrial personnel and the author's thirteen years of industrial experience\"--",
