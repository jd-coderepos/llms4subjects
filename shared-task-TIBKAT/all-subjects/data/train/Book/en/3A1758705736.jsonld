            "abstract": "\"This new Sixteenth Edition of Foundations of College Chemistry presents chemistry as a modern, vital subject and is designed to make introductory chemistry accessible to all beginning students. The central focus is the same as it has been from the first edition: to make chemistry interesting and understandable to students and teach them the problem-solving skills they will need. In preparing this new edition, we considered the comments and suggestions of students and instructors to design a revision that builds on the strengths of previous editions including clear explanations and step-by-step problem solving. We have especially tried to relate chemistry to the real lives of our students as we develop the principles that form the foundation for the further study of chemistry, and to provide them with problem-solving skills and practice needed in their future studies. We have focused on using electronic materials to enhance the student experience. To that end we have authored and added new interactive features ourselves and enhanced our existing electronic materials to draw the students into direct involvement in an active learning experience. We have added new Case Studies to many of the chapters to encourage instructors to engage their students in this learning style. Foundations of College Chemistry, 16th Edition, is intended for students who have never taken a chemistry course or those who have had a significant interruption in their studies but plan to continue with the general chemistry sequence. Since its inception, this book has helped define the preparatory chemistry course and has developed a much wider audience. In addition to preparatory chemistry, our text is used extensively in onesemester general-purpose courses (such as those for applied health fields) and in courses for nonscience majors\"--",
