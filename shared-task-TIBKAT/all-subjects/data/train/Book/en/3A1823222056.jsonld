            "abstract": "\"This book contains thirteen chapters focusing on pest management and control. The volume is broadly divided into two parts. Part I contains six chapters that deal with the role of chemicals in pest management. The opening chapter begins with the challenges and opportunities in the application of insecticides. The five additional chapters provide information on the pests of temperate fruits, pulses, spices and rice and the recent advances in their management. The concluding chapter of Part I deals with the utilization of chemicals in plant parasitic nematode management and the challenges faced thereof. In Part II, there are seven chapters devoted to microbes. The first chapter broadly explains the role of biopesticides in pest management, the new developments, challenges and future thrusts in this direction. The emphasis of the subsequent chapters shifts to different biocontrol agents viz., entomopathogenic nematodes, nematophagous fungi, bacteria and baculoviruses. One chapter deals exclusively with the integrated application of entomopathogenic nematodes and chemicals. The last chapter of the book deals extensively with the field application of biopesticides. An attempt has been made to present all important aspects and necessary guidelines for pest management in as simple and lucid a manner as possible with some essential data and nice photographs. This book will help agricultural scientists, research practitioners, extension workers, the farming community and especially those undergraduate and postgraduate students having entomology or nematology as their specialized subject\"--",
