            "abstract": "The study provides a major reassessment of the scale and scope of China\u2019s resurgence over the past half century, employing quantitative measurement techniques which are standard practice in OECD countries. It uses a comparative approach to explain why China\u2019s role in the world economy has changed so dramatically in the last thousand years. It concludes that China is likely to resume its natural role as the world\u2019s largest economy by the year 2015, thus regaining the position it had held until 1890. A dynamic link (StatLink) is provided for each table and graph, which directs the user to a web page where the corresponding data are available in Excel\u00ae format. Except for Appendix A, this edition has been revised and updated and Chapter 4 is completely new. \"..ambitious in scope and packed with facts.
