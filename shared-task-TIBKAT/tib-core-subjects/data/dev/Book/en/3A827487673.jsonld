The book begins with a discussion of sampling techniques and preservation, and then covers metals in rivers, surface groundwater, and mineral waters, as well as metals in aqueous precipitation. It concludes with detailed information on how to analyze metals in sediments. With its coverage of various procedures and techniques to be used in a variety of situations, [this book] provides a solid foundation for informed action to be taken by environmental interest groups and regulators and a starting point for further study by graduate students, professionals, and researchers.\"--Back cover",
