                "Packaged with every Windows computer, Batch is an immensely useful programming language ready to help coders and non-coders alike with routine or repetitive tasks. In addition to easily minimizing daily chores, bat files are great for logon scripts, can automate PC environment configurations, and generally make life easier regardless of what you usually code.This book covers all things bat-file-related, from the essentials through the advanced concepts, even object-oriented design. Humorous asides and examples - such as pondering the question 'what if Archimedes had Batch,' and sorting the first 8 future captains of the starship Enterprise - make the journey into Batch's inner workings a truly enjoyable one.Topics are organized into three parts of increasing complexity, making it a handy reference tool for whatever Batch task, question, or problem you encounter: Part I provides the basics, where beginners and non-power-users will learn how to write simple to moderate bat files; Part II discusses how to get things done, introducing the crucial for command and how to use it to add even more functionality to the language; Part III covers sophisticated topics at the expert level, like working with recursion and arrays, as well as testing and troubleshooting tips, culminating with object-oriented design. Regardless of your preferred programming language, anyone with a Windows PC will benefit from learning how to code with Batch - and this is the ultimate user guide",
