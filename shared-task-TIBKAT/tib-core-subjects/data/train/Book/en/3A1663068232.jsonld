            "abstract": "In 2016, architect David Tajchman made public a self-initiated high-rise proposal on which he worked in secret during a few months. He decided to propose a new typology of skyscraper, more city-specific for Tel Aviv. Based on his previous observations that a new skyline is appearing in the White City, which according to his experience of the city and his knowledge of the local architectural history, does not take enough into account the 1930s and later Brutalist legacies. His yet unbuilt (but surely to get built) skyscraper is a spontaneous proposal from a foreign architect to the local decisionmakers, to open their eyes and their minds to other visions, for a more Tel Aviv-specific vertical architecture. The 'Gran Mediterraneo' has been widely published as an architectural innovation and has won several awards gaining international recognition, with the recent Architizer A+ Awards 2017 received in New York",
