                "\"Kulper and Chard examine the potential of uncertainty in architecture. As this fits awkwardly with normal research methods they have each developed their own processes of study and proposal where the act of drawing is an important component in generating the content of the work. Their ways of working are contaminated by an ongoing (long distance) conversation where the exchange of work and ideas infect each other's practice and habits. The distance, mediation and time lag of their dialogue also contribute to this process. These conversations and the act of drawing rehearse the situations that are discussed by their drawings. There is a particular interest in the way evolving relationships might be discussed by their architecture, which might become spatially promiscuous in seeking out new associations. Kulper pushes the potential of both the tools and the process of traditional architectural drawing while Chard develops and builds drawing instruments particular to what he is working on\"--",
                "\"The competition for Pamphlet Architecture 33 asked previous authors in the series to nominate the architects and theorists whose work represents the most exciting design and research in the field today. The second of two winning entries--the first was published in Spring 2013 as PA 33--was submitted by architects and educators Perry Kulper and Nat Chard. Pamphlet Architecture 34 speculates on how architecture might discuss indeterminate conditions of production through a generative agency of representation. Kulper and Chard explore the indeterminacy of architectural research through drawings that exceed the traditional drawing space. Located in two different countries, the authors communicate by shipping each drawing across geographical borders. As a result, the drawing acts, as a tactical and conversational medium, providing the architects with new opportunities for the confluence of the uncertain\"--"
