                "This volume provides methods and protocols on principle, production, molecular aspects, and sustainability of biofuel and biodiesel. Chapters are divided into four sections detailing biofuel production, biodiesel production, molecular genetics, biotechnology of biofuel and biodiesel production, economics, and sustainability of biofuel production. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Biofuels and Biodiesel aims to be useful for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the field of biofuel and biodiesel."
