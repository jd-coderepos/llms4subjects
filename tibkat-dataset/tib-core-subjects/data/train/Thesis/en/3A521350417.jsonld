            "abstract": [
                "1,1-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals represent useful synthetic building blocks which can be regarded as masked carboxylic acid dianions. In recent years, a number of cyclization reactions of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals have been reported. Functionalized maleic anhydrides represent important synthetic building blocks, which have been employed, for example, in the synthesis of ?-alkylidenebutenolides, maleimides, 5-alkylidene-5H-pyrrol-2-ones. Substituted maleic anhydrides are available by Michael reaction of nucleophiles with parent maleic anhydride and subsequent halogenation and elimination. Oxalyl chloride is an important synthetic tool for the synthesis of O-heterocycles. 3-hydroxymaleic (1-3) anhydrides were synthesised by one-pot cyclization of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals with oxalyl chloride using TMSOTf as a catalyst. The Me3SiOTf mediated reaction of 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals with 3-silyloxyalk-2-en-1-ones, such as (4), afforded 5-ketoacids, such as (5). Treatment of the latter with TFA in CH2Cl2 afforded pyran-2-ones, such as (6-8). It has been found that 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)ketene acetals can behave as dinucleophile. Functionalized benzo-azoxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanones (9-12), were prepared by regio- and diastereoselective condensation of 1,1-bis(silyloxy)ketene acetals with isoquinolinium and quinolinium salts and subsequent regioselective and stereospecific iodolactonization ...",
