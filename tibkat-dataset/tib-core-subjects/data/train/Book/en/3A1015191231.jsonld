            "abstract": "llustrated exclusively with drawings, this book proposes a path to the discovery of the architectonic space, its aspects, its dimensions, its different interactive levels, which confer on each of its scales -- the territory, the city, the building -- a structure, an identity and a meaning varying according to place, society and culture. As a result of a process involving multiple actors, the architectonic space is approached from points of view ranging from the art of the architect to the experience of the inhabitant. Observing the spatial mutations, the crises of the place, and the language of the architecture, the authors approach the architectonic space according to a global and relational approach, beyond the conceptual, historical and aesthetic boundaries. They focus on two axes of analysis: the first focuses on the subject, on its existential experience in defining the dimensions and levels of the language of architecture; the second is centered on the object in order to understand, on the one hand, the architectonic form, its structure and its processes, and, on the other hand, the architectonic space, its scales, its operating structures and modes of organization. Considering architecture as a language, the authors analyze its different poetics, its diversity of codes, vocabularies, and writings that evolve over time and influences. The book concludes with an architectonic revisited by new paradigms of thought and action. They are the result of the planetary ecological awareness, they are the source of alternative approaches committed to the creation of places valuing cultural identities, local resources, and collective production processes while respecting the equilibrium between human settlements and the planet",
