            "abstract": "This book identifies Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a growing field that is being incorporated into many aspects of human life, including healthcare practice and delivery. The precision, automation, and potential of AI brings multiple benefits to the way disease is diagnosed, investigated and treated. Currently, there is a lack of any appreciable understanding of AI and this book provides detailed understandings, which include; foundational concepts, current applications, future challenges amongst most healthcare practitioners. The book is divided into four sections: basic concepts, current applications, limitations and future directions. Each section is comprised of chapters written by expert academics, researchers and practitioners at the intersection between AI and medicine. The purpose of the book is to promote AI literacy as an important component of modern medical practice. This book is suited for all readers as it requires no previous knowledge, it walks non-technical clinicians through the complex ideas and concepts in an easy to understand manner.",
