            "abstract": "\"International Young Physicists' Tournament (IYPT), is one of the most prestigious international physics contests among high school students. IYPT Problems and solutions 2014 is the second IYPT solution book after the publication of IYPT Problems and solutions 2012-2013 last year. It is based on the solutions of 2014 IYPT Problems. The authors are undergraduate students who participated in the CUPT (Chinese Undergraduate Physics Tournament). It is intended as a college level solution to the challenging open-ended Problems. It provides original, quantitative solutions in fulfilling seemingly impossible tasks. This book is not limited to the tasks required by the Problems and it is not confined to the models and methods in present literatures. Many of the articles include modification and extension to existing models in references, or derivation and computation based on fundamental physics. This book provides quantitative solutions to practical Problems in everyday life. Many articles in the new book include one more section: preparation for discussions. In this part, key points and questions that may be discussed in opponent's or reviewer's stages during a physics tournament are listed. Demonstration videos are provided through links to supplementary materials. http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9904 This is a good reference book for undergraduates, advanced high-school students, physics educators and curious public interested in the intriguing phenomena in daily life\"--",
