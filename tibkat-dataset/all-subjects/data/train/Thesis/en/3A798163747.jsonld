                "The UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme has been active in South Africa for almost 20 years. The country currently has six designated biosphere reserves with a few sites in various stages of the nomination process. Within the South African context, agencies are using a series of seemingly different instruments to practice landscape-scale management. The UNESCO biosphere reserve concept sometimes finds it difficult to obtain prominence amongst these different landscape initiatives. Biosphere reserves are special sites wherein sustainable development is promoted. For this reason, the biosphere reserve concept has much to offer towards long-term sustainable socialecological land management. In our modern age of population growth, dwindling natural resources and a general disconnectedness of humans from nature due to large scale urbanization, there is an urgent need for innovative ways in which to showcase sustainable living practices. South Africa has limited natural, economic and social resources and therefore needs to prioritize where these resources could best be allocated. This dissertation comprises the history of the MAB Programme in South Africa, as well as a multicase study on five existing biosphere reserves. Results from this study indicated that not all biosphere reserves are equally effective in their implementation of the three functions of biosphere reserves and that all biosphere reserves in South Africa face an uncertain future due to pressing challenges ..."
