            "abstract": "\"This new volume explores an array of emerging and advanced techniques in the food processing sector. Novel food processing methods such as ultrasound processing, microwave heating, advanced drying methods, and nonthermal technologies are discussed in detail. The volume also covers the application of irradiation in food and food products and highlights the potential of nutraceutical foods and application of encapsulation methods in the food industry. It illustrates the various applications of these new novel food processing, preservation, and encapsulation methods. Apart from new processing technologies, mathematical modeling concepts and case studies are included to illustrate applications of modeling techniques in food processing. The volume promotes the understanding of the thermodynamics of food polymers, structural design principles, structural hierarchy, and the steps involved in food structuring and structure measurement techniques. Also provided is an overview of the scope and significance of food biotechnology, the benefits, and concerns of using biotechnology in food processing, as well as microbial valorizing approach as a novel technique and a source for nutrition and nutraceuticals. Given the book's vast coverage, this volume has tremendous applications in different areas of the food industry, including in food processing, preservation, safety, and quality evaluation of processed foods\"--",
