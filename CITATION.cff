abstract: "To support the development of systems for the LLMs4Subjects shared task, we provide participants with two types of datasets: (1) a curated, human-readable form of the GND subjects taxonomy, and (2) a large-scale dataset of technical records from TIBâ€™s open-access collection, annotated with GND subjects, available in both English and German."
