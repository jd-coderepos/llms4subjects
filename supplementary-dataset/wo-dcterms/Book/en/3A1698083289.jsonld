            "abstract": "\"This book will give emphasis on the energy generation in the form of biofuels, bioelectricity or biogas using chemicals, nanomaterial, microbial, enzymatic and chemo-enzymatic integrated systems from CO2. This book has been divided into four sections. The first section is comprised of four chapters which will describe the importance and utilization of CO2 in the living system, various fundamental methods, policies and techniques of CO2 conversion. The second section will focus on the absorption and fixation of CO2 using various ionic liquids, organic solvents, amine based solutions, electro catalytic reduction, nanomaterial, porphyrins, ceramics MOFs and activated carbons and biological material particularly. This section will be covered with 5-6 chapters which will draw the insight of various chemical engineers, researchers working across the globe for CO2 conversion. After this third section will give emphasis on the production of value added products using CO2. It will contain 4-5 chapters which mainly focused on the production of bio-methanol, industrial carbonates lime, liquid and gaseous fuels, industrially useful precursors etc. In the last section this book will discusses potential of microbial system, enzymes in the sequestration of CO2 and its utilization. The combined chemo-enzymatic system for utilization of CO2 will be discussed in the respective chapters of this book. This reliable information from various active researchers and groups will be helpful to find out the alternatives for clean energy and mitigating the climatic change. This book will help the researchers and industrialists to better understand the correlation between microbial, biological and chemical products for their further use to convert the increased level of CO2 into energy based system. The final chapter will present the chemo-enzymatic system for decarbonization of automobile and industrial smoke to direct the clean emission\"--",
