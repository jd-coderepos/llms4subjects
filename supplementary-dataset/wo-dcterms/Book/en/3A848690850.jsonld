                "\"China&apos;s rapid industrialisation has led to \"an air pollution catastrophe\". Concerted efforts to achieve economic growth have led to veiled skies of toxic air and created health and morbidity problems as well as tremendous environmental degradation. China&apos;s Air Pollution Problems provides an overview of air pollution in China describing how and why China has ended up in such a dire situation, what the government is doing to address the problem and the difficulties it is encountering in attempting to reduce the pollution. The analysis is based on both grey literature (newspaper articles, NGO reports, Chinese government information) and on academic studies. The grey literature gives a voice to those who suffer from the pollution, their advocates, and government officers, and allows the reader to better grasp the conditions on the ground, and the impact of air pollution among people in different areas in China. The academic literature adds a theoretical perspective and brings these different case studies into a broader context. This book will be of great interest to students of environmental pollution and contemporary Chinese studies looking for an introduction to the topic and also for researchers looking for an extensive list of sources and analysis of China&apos;s environmental problems.\"--",
