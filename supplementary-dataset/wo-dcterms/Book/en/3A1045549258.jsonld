                "This book brings together a thought-provoking collection of original contributions to the study of sexual crime prevention. Written in an accessible and practical style, the book begins with an exploration of the theoretical underpinnings of sexual crime prevention, as well as the history and development of prevention work over the years, providing an overview of prevention initiatives around the world. The second section spotlights three in depth case studies of organisations delivering prevention work in the UK. Final sections of the book explore the service user experience, impact of the media, and attitudes and consideration of future directions for prevention work. The book is relevant not only to psychologists, criminologists, social workers and students, but to practitioners, researchers and anyone with an interest in learning about sexual crime prevention.
