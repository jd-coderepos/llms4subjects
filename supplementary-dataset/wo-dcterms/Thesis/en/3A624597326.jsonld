            "abstract": "Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in the universe - in any case intriguing enough for me so as to become an astronomer. It is today generally accepted that black holes are located in the center of most galaxies. One particular species of galaxies is that of the so-called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which display energetic phenomena in their central region that are comparable to or even exceed the energy emitted by all of the galaxies ̉stars by orders of magnitude. The first group of AGN with high central surface brightness, that was observed in the optical in the early 1940s by Carl Seyfert, had not been considered significant until 1955 when the AGN were identified as radio sources. In the late 1950s the first radio surveys were performed which enabled an identification of the strongest radio sources with their optical counterparts which were usually galaxies, but sometimes appeared to be star-like objects. This consequently led to the term quasi-stellar radio source or quasi-stellar object which later turned into q̉uasarỏr Q̉SO.̉ Only the discovery of Schmidt (1963), that the optical spectrum of the star-like object 3C273 is in fact highly redshifted and hence of cosmological origin, enabled an efficient identification of quasars ...",
