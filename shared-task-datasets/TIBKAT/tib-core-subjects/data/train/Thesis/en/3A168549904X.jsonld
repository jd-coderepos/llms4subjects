            "abstract": "The aim of this cumulative thesis was to investigate on the one hand whether vaccinations with inactivated Bluetongue Virus (BTV)-8 vaccines induce antibodies in sheep still detectable after five to seven and a half years. On the other hand, different vaccination schemes and techniques in sheep using inactivated BTV-4 and BTV-8 vaccines were compared under field conditions. In the first study, the presence of BTV antibodies was proven five to seven and a half year after previous vaccinations with inactived BTV-8 vaccines. Boosted vaccinations improved seropositivity, but even after only one vaccination antibodies were found after seven and a half years. In the second study, eight different vaccination schemes, using four commercially available inactivated Bluetongue vaccines against serotypes 4 and 8 were tested in three different combinations (setting 1-3) under field conditions for their ability to generate a measurable immune response in 240 sheep. All vaccine combinations were well tolerated by all sheep. In setting 1, there were no relevant significant differences in the immunogenic response between simultaneously applied vaccines at different sites or at the same injection site with a twin-syringe. Importantly, a one-shot vaccination induced comparable immunogenicity to a boosted injection. Low serotype-specific neutralising antibody levels were detected in settings 2 and 3 and are attributed to diverse factors, which may have influenced the measured immunogenicity, due to the setting as a field trial. The results of the described studies propose that vaccination recommendations could be simplified substantially to motivate more farmers to vaccinate their ruminant livestock.",
