                "Recent climate change has affected the forest system comprehensively. Northern hemisphere elevational treelines are considered as a key environment for monitoring the effects of current anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, trees from these areas are also widely employed in paleo-climate reconstructions. The stability of the tree growth climate relationship under current scenario is crucial for all tree ring based climate researches. It is important to investigate how trees respond to this rapid environmental change at altitudinal treelines. Tree cores from 21 treeline sites of three species (Pinus tabulaeformis, Picea crassifolia, and Sabina przewalskii) from Northeastern Tibetan have been conducted in this thesis. The instable correlations between tree growth and climate are the general response pattern of trees from all study sites in NE Tibetan Plateau. Picea crassifolia shows the most instable response to climate factors (mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation). Pinus tabulaeformis and Sabina przewalskii just showed instable and divergent responses to their main limiting climate factors but no clear trend was found which is limited by the few sample sites. Corresponding to divergent responses of Picea crassifolia to mean monthly temperature, most radial growth of Picea crassifolia were inhibited by this climate change type drought, only few trees within same sites grew faster due to temperature increasing during recent decades ..."
