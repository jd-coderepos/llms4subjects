            "abstract": "Among the natural hazards, landslides are attracting more and more attention due to its increasing effect on economic and human losses. While hazard zonation mapping plays a vital role in identifying the vulnerable zones for future land-use planning activities, designing of early warning systems and adequate mitigation measures in landslide-prone areas, lack of real time early warnings significantly increases the damages world wide. Landslides associated with intense rain during monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons are the most pressing natural disaster in the Central Highland of Sri Lanka. About 13,000 km2 (20% area of the country) within ten administrative districts are considered to be prone to landslides and almost 42% of the total population of the country is living in these districts. According to the available records, major landslides occurred during past three decades until 2008 have caused a loss of more than 775 human lives making over 90,000 people homeless. Most significantly, Galle, Matara, and Hambantota districts which had not been considered earlier as landslide prone regions were severely affected by the catastrophic event occurred on 17th May 2003 killing more than 150 people in a single day. 855 houses were completely destroyed and another 2858 were damaged rendering almost 20,000 people homeless. Every year huge economic and human losses are recorded and damages are on the rise throughout the island. This is because people live everywhere at their own risk and use even the marginal lands for housing, farming, infrastructure and development activities ...",
