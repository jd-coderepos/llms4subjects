            "abstract": "This thesis develops new methods to assess two types of financial risk. Market risk is defined as the risk of losing money due to drops in the values of asset portfolios. Systemic risk refers to the breakdown risk for the financial system induced by the distress of individual companies. During the financial crisis 2007\u20132009, both types of risk materialized, resulting in huge losses for investors, companies, and tax payers all over the world. Therefore, considering new risk management alternatives is of interest for both financial institutions and regulatory authorities. A common feature of the models used throughout the thesis is that they adapt quantile regression techniques to the context of financial risk management in a novel way. Firstly, to predict extreme market risk, nonparametric quantile regression is combined with extreme value theory. The resulting extreme Value at Risk (VaR) forecast framework is applied to different international stock indices. In many situations, its performance is superior to parametric benchmark models. Secondly, a systemic risk measure, the realized systemic risk beta, is proposed. In contrast to exististing measures it is tailored to account for tail risk interconnections within the financial sector, individual firm characteristics, and financial indicators. To determine each company\u2019s relevant risk drivers, model selection techniques for high-dimensional quantile regression are employed. The realized systemic risk beta corresponds to the total effect of each firm\u2019s VaR on the system\u2019s VaR. Using data on major financial institutions in the U.S. and in Europe, it is shown that the new measure is a valuable tool to both estimate and forecast systemic risk.",
