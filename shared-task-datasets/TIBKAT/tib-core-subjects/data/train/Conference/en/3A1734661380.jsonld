                "This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed proceedings of the CAiSE Forum 2020 which was held as part of the 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, CAiSE 2020, in June 2020. The conference was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAiSE Forum is a place within the CAiSE conference for presenting and discussing new ideas and tools related to information systems engineering. Intended to serve as an interactive platform, the Forum aims at the presentation of emerging new topics and controversial positions, as well as demonstration of innovative systems, tools and applications. This year\u2019s theme was \u201cResponsible Information Systems\u201d. The 12 full papers presented in this volume were carefully reviewed and selected from 19 submissions. .",
