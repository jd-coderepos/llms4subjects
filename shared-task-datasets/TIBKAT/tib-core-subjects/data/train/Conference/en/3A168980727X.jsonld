                "The changes brought about by digital technology and the consequent explosion of information known as Big Data have brought opportunities and challenges in all areas of society, and the law is no exception.This book, Knowledge of the Law in the Big Data Age contains a selection of the papers presented at the conference \"Law via the Internet 2018\", held in Florence, Italy, on 11-12 October 2018. This annual conference of the \"Free Access to Law Movement\" (http://www.fatlm.org) hosted more than 60 international speakers from universities, government and research bodies as well as EU institutions.Topics covered range from free access to law and Big Data and data analytics in the legal domain, to policy issues concerning access, publishing and the dissemination of legal information, tools to support democratic participation and opportunities for digital democracy. The book is divided into 3 sections: Part I provides an introductory background, covering aspects such as the evolution of legal science and models for representing the law; Part II addresses the present and future of access to law and to various legal information sources; and Part III covers updates in projects, initiatives, and concrete achievements in the field. The book provides an overview of the practical implementation of legal information systems and the tools to manage this special kind of information, as well as some of the critical issues which must be faced, and will be of interest to all those working at the intersection of law and technology. --",
