Designed specifically for one-semester courses, it is beautifully illustrated in full colour to explain the key concepts in mineralogy and petrology. This revision has been fully updated based on classroom experience. Including a completely new chapter providing an elementary introduction to thermodynamics, kinetics, radioactive decay and absolute dating, this new edition also features new mineral descriptions and many new stunning color photographs. A new section on hydraulic fracturing and discussion of some of its most serious potential environmental consequences has also been added. Stunning photos of mineral specimens and rock thin sections help students build a core understanding, whilst close intergration of clear illustrations with engaging text create a highly effective learning experience\"--",
