                "\"The Cambridge Handbook of Engineering Education Research is the critical reference source for the growing field of engineering education research, featuring the work of world luminaries writing to define and inform this emerging field. Since a landmark issue of the Journal of Engineering Education in 2005, in which senior scholars argued for a stronger theoretical and empirically driven agenda, engineering education has quickly emerged as a research-driven field with an increasing quality and quantity of both theoretical and empirical work that draws on many social science disciplines, disciplinary engineering knowledge, and computing. The Handbook draws extensively on contemporary research in the learning sciences, examining how technology affects learners and learning environments, and the role of social context in learning.\"--",
                "\"This volume reflects the richness and comprehensiveness of the emerging field of EER and will be of tremendous utility to students as well as those seeking an introductory overview. The editors have carefully selected authors who are leading, globally-recognized scholars writing in their areas of expertise. This volume comes at a particularly opportune time as the broad engineering education community seeks to better define the required elements of a 21st Century engineering education in an increasingly integrated global community where the solutions to a growing array of social, political, and economic challenges require access to engineering knowledge. The traditional image of the solitary engineer is no longer valid. Successful engineering research, innovation and practice require collaboration with and integration of professionals from other fields. The engineering education system faces stresses from larger changes within education systems overall, especially political pressures to reduce costs, and stresses on engineering faculty to be increasingly effective in teaching, research, and service. There is a tremendous need for a robust research base to inform future practice in this unfamiliar environment. This volume serves as an important tool for accomplishing this goal\"--"
