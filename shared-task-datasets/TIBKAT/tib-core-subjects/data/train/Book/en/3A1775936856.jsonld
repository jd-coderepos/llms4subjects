                "\"Comprehensive and Integrative Architectural Design addresses integrative design - design that bridges the gap between architectural design and architectural technology. With its roots in sustainability, and with the universal acceptance of data driven design, it is widely acknowledged that integrative design completed in a comprehensive way is the process that will lead to a more sustainable and responsible built environment. Organized in order of the design process itself-pre-design, schematic design, and design development-this title demonstrates and instructs how design and technology are integrated. Another important feature of the text is how it clarifies the different ways in which the collateral organizations in architecture approach the discipline. This textbook brings together all the variations of terminology and the perspective of each organization in support of creating a comprehensive and integrative architectural design. Comprehensive and Integrative Architectural Design provides architecture students and faculty a definitive resource to assist them in executing an integrative solution to an architectural project. There are literally thousands of decisions that must be made when designing a building, from pre-design to schematic design to design development. With over 150 color illustrations, this text provides a framework for both instructors and students\"--",
