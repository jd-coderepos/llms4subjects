                "Digital Competence and Future Skills How companies prepare themselves for the digital future The world is changing continuously and rapidly \u2013 especially for companies. In this volatile environment, there is much talk about the need to build digital competence, future skills and lifelong learning. To remain competitive, 21st century executives, departments and HR managers must succeed in empowering employees and management for the future. To do this, competencies must be managed holistically and dynamically, learning systems require consistent further development, and a learning culture must emerge that creates motivational moments for the company\u2018s own employees and customers. Building digital competence is not a short-term training project of the typical kind; rather, a holistic approach is needed that affects all areas of the company and raises numerous questions: - What is digital competence? - How to de\ufb01 ne it? How to measure it? - Which people need which digital skills? - Who is responsible for this skill revolution? - How do we learn digital skills? - What is the role of HR? - How do new learning ecosystems emerge? This unique book provides comprehensive insight into the future of competencies and learning and the transformation of business. For the first time, leading companies from a wide range of industries around the world provide concrete insights into their comprehensive approaches to transformation, competence management, culture change, and learning and development. In addition, leading scientists and institutions use the latest research findings to assess where we are today and what is to come in the future."
