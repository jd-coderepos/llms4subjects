            "abstract": "\"Forming connections between human performance and design, this new edition of Engineering Psychology and Human Performance examines human-machine interaction. The book is organized directly from a psychological perspective of human information processing and chapters correspond to the flow of information as it is processed by a human being-from the senses, through the brain, to action-rather than from the perspective of system components or engineering design concepts. Upon completing this book, readers will be able to: identify how human ability contributes to the design of technology; understand the connections within human information processing and human performance; challenge the way they think about technology's influence on human performance; and show how theoretical advances have been, or might be, applied to improving human-machine interaction. This new edition includes the following key features: A new chapter on research methods Sections on interruption management and distracted driving as representation of cogent examples of applications of engineering psychology theory to problems in society A greatly increased number of references to pandemics, technostress, and misinformation New applications Amplified emphasis on readability and common-sense examples Updated and new references throughout the text This book is ideal for psychology and engineering students, as well as practitioners in engineering psychology, human performance, and human factors. The text is also supplemented by online resources for students and instructors\"--",
