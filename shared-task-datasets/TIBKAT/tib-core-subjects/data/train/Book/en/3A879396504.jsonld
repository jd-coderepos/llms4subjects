This new edition covers methods for shelf-life and stability evaluation, reviewing the modelling and testing of the deterioration of products as well as the use of sensory evaluation methods for testing food spoilage. The first part of the book focuses on deteriorative processes and factors influencing shelf-life, covering aspects such as chemical deterioration, physical instability and microbiological spoilage. The effects of process and packaging on the stability and shelf-life of products are also covered in this part. Part Two reviews the methods for shelf life and stability evaluation. These include sensory evaluation methods and instrumental methods to determine food quality deterioration. The final section of the book covers stability of important ingredient categories, from oils and fats, to beverages such as beer, wine, coffee and fruit juices, in addition to bakery products and meats. With updated chapters reflecting advances made in the field and with the addition of new chapters covering the stability and shelf-life a variety of products, this new edition will provide the latest research for both academics working in the field of food quality as well as providing essential information for food scientists working in industry. Thoroughly revised and updated edition of a very popular and well regarded bookIncludes dedicated chapters covering the shelf-life and stability of specific products making this book ideal for those working in industryPresents a wide coverage of the processes and factors influencing shelf-life, the evaluation of stability and shelf-life and the stability and shelf-life of particular products makes this book valuable for both academics and those working in industry",
