Bioactive constituents present in grapes and vines, mainly polyphenols, are attracting increasing interest from consumers demanding polyphenol-rich foods as a result of epidemiological evidence suggesting the protective potential of polyphenols against chronic diseases directly associated with oxidative damage, such as Alzheimer's, cancers, diabetes, and hypertension, amongst others. In this regard, besides the traditional products from grapes, such as wine and juice, grape Vitis by-products are increasingly being re-utilized and transformed into high-value products for the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. In this context, the book Vitis Products: Composition, Health Benefits and Economic Valorization intends to deeply discuss many aspects of the products derived from grapevines, including the diversity and potential of a wide range of economical possibilities, factors involved in their composition, varietal differences, and industrial process, showing a wide range of possibilities\"--",
