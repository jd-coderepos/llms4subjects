            "abstract": "\"The book is dedicated to colour, which has long attracted the attention of scientists. It is written by a color specialist with a background in mathematics and a professional mathematician. Despite the efforts of many luminaries of physics, the science of colour, in the true sense of the word does not exist as yet. One reason is that physicists don't know colour perception well enough, and psychologists don't know mathematics well enough. A paradoxical situation has arisen - there is colour engineering, but there is no mathematical theory of colour. This book aims to provide the reader with a systematic presentation of various aspects of existing knowledge about colour, and exposes a new approach developed by one of the authors. Guided by Hering's idea of component hues, the authors attempt a new approach to colour perception based on the same theoretical framework as that used to expose the main results obtained in colorimetry. It allowed them to develop techniques to measure colour appearance with an accuracy meeting, they believe, the standards adopted in colorimetric measurements. Thus, it differs from previous books in that the mathematics used is necessary to solve problems in the course of the study\"--",
