            "abstract": "\"5G technology is the next step in the evolution of wireless communication. It offers faster speeds and more bandwidth than 4G. One of the biggest differences between 4G and 5G is that 5G will be used for a wider range of applications. This makes it ideal for applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and the internet of things. This means that there will be more devices connected to 5G networks, making them more vulnerable to cyber attacks. However, 5G also introduces new cyber risks that need to be addressed. In addition, 5 G networks are expected to be much more complex, making them harder to secure. 5G networks will use new technologies that could make them more vulnerable to attack. These technologies include massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output), which uses more antennas than traditional cellular networks, and millimeter wave (mmWave), which uses higher frequencies than traditional cellular networks. These new technologies could make it easier for attackers to intercept data or disrupt service. To address these concerns, security measures must be implemented throughout the network. Security mechanisms must be included in the design of 5G networks and must be updated as new threats are identified. Moreover, to address these risks, 5 G security standards need to be developed and implemented. These standards should include measures to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, malware infections, and other threats. Fortunately, artificial intelligence can play a key role in mitigating these risks. With so many interconnected devices, it can be difficult to identify and isolate malicious traffic. AI can help by identifying patterns in data that would otherwise be undetectable to humans. 6G technology is still in the early developmental stages, but security experts are already voicing concerns about the potential challenges that could arise with this next generation of mobile connectivity. Experts are already working on a roadmap for 6G deployment, and they are confident that these and other challenges can be overcome\"--",
