                "Learn how to design smart grids, the energy delivery systems of the futureA smart grid is an electrical grid that can monitor, predict, and intelligently respond to the behavior of all electric power suppliers and consumers connected to it in order to deliver reliable and sustainable electricity services as efficiently as possible. Smart Grid sets forth the fundamental analysis and design schemes for developing actual working smart grids. Readers will find all the guidance, tools, and techniques needed to design smart grids that meet the needs of government, industry, and consumers, including:. Standards and requirements for designing essential devices, systems, and products. Automation and computational techniques to design adaptable smart grids. Simulation tools for modeling smart grid performance. Incorporation of sustainable and renewable energy sources. Evaluation of different options for computational intelligence, communication technology, and decision supportThroughout the book, detailed examples of smart grid design and development strategies are provided based on different community constraints and energy needs.Given the ever-rising costs of dwindling fossil fuel energy supplies, the need to provide sustainable energy as efficiently as possible has never been greater. This pioneering book is a must-read for electrical and power engineering professionals and students, giving them the tools needed to move from the concept of a smart grid to its actual design and implementation. Moreover, it will enable regulators, policymakers, and energy executives to understand the future of energy delivery systems",
