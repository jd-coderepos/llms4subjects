                "Landmark findings and best practices from software engineering pioneer Barry W. Boehm based on forty years of research and experienceThis book presents forty-two of Barry W. Boehm's best articles on software engineering, organizes them into nine chapters with newly written summaries by nine of his colleagues, and concludes with a new chapter on Barry's \"thoughts for the future.\" The book chapters address:. Software Architecture and Quality. Software Economics. Software Tools. Software Process: Early Spiral Model. Software Risk Management. Software Process: Emerging Extensions. Software and Systems Management. Software Engineering State of the Art and Practice. Value-Based Software Engineering. A Software Engineer in the Software CenturyThis book is recommended as a guide and resource for software engineers, project managers, and technology executives as well as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses.\"In my view, Barry Boehm is single-handedly responsible for turning software engineering from an anecdote-driven, opinion-laden art form into data-driven, fact-based engineering.\"-Dr. William A. Wulf, President, National Academy of Engineering\"This book is a must-read for all software engineers.\"-Dr. Yannis C. Yortsos, Dean, Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California\"Barry Boehm has led the effort to put a sound footing under software engineering. His Software Engineering Economics provided fact-grounded models that first enabled us to move beyond speculation in budgeting and scheduling. His spiral development model and risk-management strategies each constitute major advances in our thinking.\"-Dr. Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., Kenan Professor of Computer Science, University of North Carolina\"This book makes clear Barry Boehm's enormous contributions to software engineering over several decades and provides a perspective no one else could have given.\"-Dr. Victor R. Basili, Professor of Computer Science, University of Maryland\"This collection of articles illuminates why Barry Boehm is one of the software industry's most trusted advisors.\"-Walker E. Royce, Vice President, IBM Rational\"Barry Boehm has spent much of his adult life guiding us and our industry; I, for one, am full of gratitude.\"-Tom DeMarco, Principal, The Atlantic Systems Guild\"Read Boehm's hints that will make your software shop tick.\"-Dr. Lawrence Bernstein, Professor of Software Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology\"Barry Boehm's insights into software ..."
