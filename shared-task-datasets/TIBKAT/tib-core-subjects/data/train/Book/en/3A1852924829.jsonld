                "This book reviews applications of nanomaterial and nanodevices in the food industry. It also discusses the advanced bioanalytical techniques, including Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), immunoanalytical techniques, monoclonal antibody-based immunological techniques for detecting food adulterations and allergens. It comprehensively covers electrode modification and nano-engineered fabrication of biosensors to enhance their functionalities for utilization in food industries. The book highlights the utilization of nanobiosensors for food safety and quality analysis, such as detection of toxin, food-borne pathogen, allergen, and evaluation of toxicity. Further, it also summarizes the recent advances in nanodevices such as nano-systems, nano-emulsions, nanopesticide, nanocapsule and their applications in the food industry. Lastly, it covers nanomaterial-based sensors for drug analysis in diverse matrices. It serves as an invaluable source of information for professionals, researchers, academicians, and students related to food science and technology."
