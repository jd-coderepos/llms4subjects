                "\"This book addresses some of the countless challenges faced by developing countries when adopting sustainable design and construction and offers suggestions for the way forward for African development projects. The authors argue that the pervasive non-consideration of the interrelationship between the elements of sustainable design and construction is the reason for the current failures in sustainable design and construction in developed countries. The book develops a System Dynamics model of the relationship between the elements of sustainable design and construction. This model involves a causal loop and stock and flow diagrams of the interrelationship among the elements of sustainability. By treating sustainability as a complex system that needs to be modeled, the authors provide the missing link between the design and construction of projects in a sustainable way with a view to improving industry and project performance. In doing so the book posits the need for improved sustainability practice in developing countries, lessons for developing countries from the successes and failures of sustainability adoption by developed nations, factors influencing adoption of sustainability and effects of sustainable designs and construction on productivity, human health and the environment at large. This book will be of interest to construction researchers, practitioners, and professional bodies, housing policy makers and government institutions as well as training and funding providers in these areas\"--"
