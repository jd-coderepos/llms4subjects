So it's got proof of concept from \"here to the end of the block\" and I want you to take heart in that if the going gets a bit rough. The book is designed for (i) persons who don't necessarily have experience in computer coding or physics, (ii) nonphysics and nonscience majors in community colleges, colleges and universities, (iii) students in Professional Science Masters' or other nonphysics graduate programs, and (iv) high school students in science courses. It's meant to support, encourage, and empower the reader to do some decent simulations of routine things with smatterings of what's beyond in order to challenge you to grow and expand\"--"
