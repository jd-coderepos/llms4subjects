                "\"The book gives useful insight on various machine learning techniques for cyber security analytics. Nowadays around 98% objects and devices are connected with the outside world through sensors and actuators. They are increasingly networked with one another and on the internet.This book gives a comprehensive overview of security issues in cyber physical systems by examining and analyzing the vulnerabilities. It also brings current understanding of common web vulnerabilities and its analysis while maintaining awareness and knowledge of contemporary standards, practices, procedures and methods of Open Web Application Security Project. This book is a medium to funnel creative energy and develop new skills of hacking and analysis of security. It also aids to plunge into a career in cybersecurity to even the unlearned. This book also expedites the learning of the basics of investigating crimes, including intrusion from the outside and damaging practices from the inside, how criminals apply across devices, networks, and the internet at large and analysis of security data. It also expounds on how to analyse in order to recover information after a cybercrime\"",
