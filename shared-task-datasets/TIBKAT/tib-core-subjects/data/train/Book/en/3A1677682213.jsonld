Why are your friends so similar to you? Why are citizens of the United States more religious than those in Western Europe?

This combined approach ensures that students become familiar with the core of sociology: key concepts, theories, perspectives, methods, and findings. Students will acquire the ability to think like a sociologist, investigate and understand complex social phenomena.
