            "abstract": "\"Current trends in population growth suggest that global food production is unlikely to meet future demand under projected climate change scenarios unless the pace of plant improvement is accelerated. Plant production is facing many challenges due to changing environmental conditions and the growing demand for new plant-derived materials. These challenges come at a time when plant science is making significant progress in understanding the basic processes of plant growth and development. Major abiotic stresses like drought, heat, cold and salinity often cause a range of morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes affecting plant growth, development and productivity, so sustainable food production poses a serious challenge to much of the world, particularly in emerging countries. This underscores the urgent need to find better ways to translate new advances in plant science into concrete successes in agricultural production. In order to overcome the negative effects of abiotic stress and to maintain food security in the face of these challenges, new, improved and resilient plant varieties, contemporary breeding techniques and a deep understanding of the mechanisms for offsetting harmful climate change are undoubtedly necessary to maintain the necessary food supply. In this context, Plants Production in the era of climate change, this book provides a guide to the latest development of the most advanced, helps in the understanding of plant response to abiotic stress, leading to new horizons and the strategy for the current translation studies application overall solution to create a powerful production and crop improvement in such an adverse environment. Written by a diverse faction of internationally famed scholars, this book adds new horizons in the field of abiotic stress tolerance\"--",
