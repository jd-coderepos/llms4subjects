                "\"This book is the third of the 3-volume Innovative Approaches in Diagnosis and Management of Crop Diseases, which provides an abundance of new research and information on major diseases of various crops along with new techniques and technology for the detection of plant pathogens along with appropriate management strategies. Divided into three volumes and with chapters written by renowned and expert scientists working in different areas of plant pathology, the volumes cover important diseases of crops, incited by bacteria, fungi, viruses, viroids, phytoplasma, and nematodes. This multi-volume set addresses these disease challenges to commercial field and horticultural crops and their management. Volume 3: Nanomolecules and Biocontrol Agents explores the use of new ways to prevent and mitigate plant diseases. These include novel green nanotechnologies; biosensors; biological management using phyllosphere-, rhizosphere-, and endosphere-derived biocontrol agents; employing biofumigation techniques; and plant immunization approaches. The book also considers the special challenge of plant disease management under the present climate change scenario. Key features: Presents diverse research of leading plant pathologists on detection, diagnosis, and management of crop diseases Shares innovative and emerging techniques for diagnosis and management of major plant diseases Covers a vast array of important crops and their diseases\"--"
