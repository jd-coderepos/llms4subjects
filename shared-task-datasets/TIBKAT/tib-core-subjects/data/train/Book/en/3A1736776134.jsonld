                "\"Bioanalytical science and its technological sub-domain biosensors are ever-evolving subjects, striving for rapid improvement in their performances and expanding the target range to meet the vast societal and market demands. The key performance factors that drive the research are selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility with an additional requirement for the biosensors are rapid, portable, and inexpensive analysis power. These performance factors are largely governed by the materials and techniques being used in these bioanalytical platforms. The selection of materials to meet these requirements is critical, as their interaction or involvement with the biological recognition elements should initiate or improve these performance factors. The connotation, technique, here is mostly implied to transducers involved in converting the biochemical signal to optical or electrical signals. Over the years, the emergence of novel materials and techniques has drastically improved the performance of these bioanalytical systems enabling these to expand their analytical horizon. These advanced materials and techniques are central to modern bioanalytical and biosensor research. Advanced materials and techniques for biosensors and bioanalytical applications comprehensively reviewed the subject, providing a knowledge platform for both academics and researchers. Considering biosensors as a central theme to this book, an outline on this subject with background principles has been included, with a scope of extending utility of the book to the course work in graduate and postgraduate schools. This book serves as a reference book for scientific investigators and textbook for a graduate-level course in biosensors and advanced bioanalytical techniques\"--",
