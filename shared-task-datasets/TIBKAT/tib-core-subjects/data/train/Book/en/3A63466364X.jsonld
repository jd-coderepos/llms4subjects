                "\"Do you need to get up to speed quickly on the technologies and services that could transform the wireless world over the coming decade? Whether you work directly with wireless or in a sector where wireless solutions could be beneficial (e.g. healthcare, transport, sensor networks, location and smart metering), this concise guide provides a critical insight into future developments. For the first time, you will have a clear view of all the key technologies, including mesh networks, white space/cognitive devices, 4G/LTE and femtocells, and all the sectors or applications in which they could be used, with a comparison of the positives and negatives of each technology and sector area. You'll also see where the technologies required overlap and so could bring benefits across multiple areas, as well as how the key drivers of change in the past may impact on the future\"--",
                "\"Wireless communications seems to be an area of frequent and rapid change. New concepts such as updating a Twitter accounts from a mobile phone arise and become pervasive in less than a year. New devices like the iPhone capture the public imagination within weeks of being launched and in turn change the relationships between the key players in the industry. Satellite navigation seems to be rapidly incorporated in most mobile devices which themselves are typically replaced in only 18 months\"--",
