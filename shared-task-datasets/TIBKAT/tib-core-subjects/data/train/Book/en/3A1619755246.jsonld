                "\"Ten years have passed since the first global ranking of universities was published. Since then, university rankings have continued to attract the attention of policymakers and the academy, challenging perceived wisdom about the status and reputation, as well as quality and performance, of higher education institutions. Their impact and influence has impacted and influenced policymakers, students and parents, employers and other stakeholders - in addition to higher education institutions around the world. They are now a significant factor shaping institutional ambition and reputation, and national priorities.The second edition of Rankings and the Reshaping of Higher Education brings the story of rankings up-to-date. It contains new original research, and extensive analysis of the rankings phenomenon. Ellen Hazelkorn draws together a wealth of international experience to chronicle how rankings are helping reshape higher education in the age of globalization. Written in an easy but authoritative style, this book makes an important contribution to our understanding of rankings and global changes in higher education. It is essential reading for policymakers, institutional leaders, managers, advisors, and scholars. \"--",
