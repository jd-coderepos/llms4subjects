            "abstract": "\"SAE International formed an IVHM (Integrated Vehicle Health Management) Steering Group in the fall of 2010. The idea reflected the large number of groups, within SAE's organization, that deal with health management of systems or subsystems (but without the integrated, holistic view of the vehicle asset or fleet). The newly formed group, through the IVHM HM-1 technical group, proceeded to organize an IVHM technical track for the SAE AeroTech meeting in Toulouse in October 2011 and also had the idea for a book on IVHM that could be handed out to participants to promote engagement in this exciting new field. The book: Integrated Vehicle Health Management: Perspectives on an Emerging Field [Jennions 2011] was the result and, surprisingly, it spawned a trilogy of books, of which this is the fourth! This current book, the fourth and (maybe) last in the series, covers the broad area of implementation and lessons learned. It endeavours to draw upon the experience that has been gained by fielding the technologies that have been discussed through the first three books. By its very nature, the insight in fielding these technologies comes not only from the aerospace sector but from a number of other interesting and challenging areas. As such, this book has sought out authors from sectors such as computer forensics and biotech, as well as rail. It is also important that some of the lessons to be learned are not purely technical but involve human factors and issues such as trust in data and IVHM systems, issues that will also be covered here. It is hoped that through books such as this, time and cost can be taken out of the implementation of new systems and IVHM can realize its true value in the marketplace\"--Provided by publisher",
