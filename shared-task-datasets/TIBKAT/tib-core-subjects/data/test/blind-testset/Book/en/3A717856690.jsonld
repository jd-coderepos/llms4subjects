            "abstract": "Founded in 1967, DP Architects was one of the seminal firms responsible for the urban landscape of Singapore. Guided by the simple philosophy that architecture of excellence enriches the human experience and spirit, early notable works like Golden Mile Complex and People's Park Complex revolutionized retail development and high-rise living. Now a leading architecture firm in Asia, DP Architects continues to make an impact on the evolving cityscapes of Singapore and beyond. Responsible for the largest shopping mall in the world, The Dubai Mall, the world-class concert hall Esplanade Theatres on the Bay, and instrumental in the master planning and transformation of Singapore's famous shopping strip Orchard Road, DP Architects' portfolio is remarkable in its diversity of scale and typology. This monograph chronicles the DP Architects story, placing the firm's groundbreaking works in the context of Singapore's urban history and documenting in detail the significant projects of its 44 years",
