                "\"This important resource draws from counseling and higher education professionals' insights to unpack real-life dilemmas of students in distress both inside and outside the classroom, while providing readers with essential tools and recommendations for assisting distressed students. The chapters in Part I examine the impact of emotional and mental health on the college campus, what college campuses are doing to address students' emotional and mental issues, the potential legal implications when dealing with students, and how faculty can and should approach this challenging topic. Each chapter in Part II includes a case narrative, along with a \"Takeaways\" section, which outlines and delineates the primary points faculty should consider when facing similar episodes involving distressed students. A \"Questions for Reflection\" section provides an opportunity for the reader to apply knowledge, reflect on their decision-making, and generate ideas individually or with peers. Helping College Students in Distress is a roadmap providing direction and examples of best practices for Higher Education faculty on the \"front lines\" in academia\"--",
