                "This volume explores analytical methods to study complex lipid mixtures from plants and algae. The chapters in this book are organized into five parts and cover topics such as basic methods of lipid isolation and analysis; mass spectrometry and NMR analysis; lipid isolation and analysis from plant tissues, cell compartments and organelles; lipid signaling, lipid-protein interactions, and imaging; and lipid databases. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and comprehensive, Plant Lipids: Methods and Protocols is a valuable guide for experienced researchers and undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. students. This book is also an excellent resource for novice scientists with little to no experience in lipid experiments who are interested in approaching this field experimentally. ."
