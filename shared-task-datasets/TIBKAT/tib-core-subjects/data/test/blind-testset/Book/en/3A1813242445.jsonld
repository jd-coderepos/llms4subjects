                "This book provides comprehensive discussion on key topics related to the usage and deployment of AI in urban transportation systems including drones. The book presents intelligent solutions to overcome the challenges of static approaches in the transportation sector to make them intelligent, adaptive, agile, and flexible. The book showcases different AI-deployment models, algorithms, and implementations related to intelligent cyber physical systems (CPS) along with their pros and cons. Even more, this book provides deep insights into the CPS specifically about the layered architecture and different planes, interfaces, and programmable network operations. The deployment models for AI-based CPS are also included with an aim towards the design of interoperable and intelligent CPS architectures by researchers in future. The authors present hands on practical implementations, deployment scenarios, and use cases related to different transportation scenarios. In the end, the design and research challenges, open issues, and future research directions are provided. Presents application use cases of AI-based cyber physical systems (CPS) in urban transportation; Includes practical models, algorithms and implementations for AI solutions; Includes detailed implementation of intelligent algorithms along with evaluation results.",
