            "abstract": "This book discusses energy recovery technology, a green innovation that can be used in buildings. This technology reduces energy consumption in buildings and provides energy savings to conventional mechanical ventilation systems. Divided into eight chapters, the book provides in-depth technical information, state-of-the-art research, and latest developments in the energy recovery technology field. Case-studies describe worldwide applications of energy recovery technology and its integrated system for building services. This book will be used as a general and technical reference book for students, engineers, professionals, practitioners, scientists, and researchers seeking to reduce energy consumption of buildings in various climatic conditions. Presents an overview of energy consumption scenarios in buildings and the needs for energy-efficient technologies at regional and global levels; Explains models and methods of energy recovery technology performance evaluation; Inspires further research into energy recovery technology for building applications.",
