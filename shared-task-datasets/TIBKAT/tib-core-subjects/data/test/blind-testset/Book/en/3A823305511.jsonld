                "Introduction -- Getting started with Swift -- Introducing actions -- Putting expressions together -- Using components and subcomponents -- The part of tens. - Shows new and existing programmers how to quickly port existing Objective-C applications into Swift and get into the swing of the new language like a pro. Designed from the ground up to be a simpler programming language, it's never been easier to get started creating apps for the iPhone or iPad, or applications for Mac OS X. Inside the book, you'll find out how to set up Xcode for a new Swift application, use operators, objects, and data types, and control program flow with conditional statements. You'll also get the scoop on creating new functions, statements, and declarations, learn useful patterns in an object-oriented environment, and take advantage of frameworks to speed your coding along. Plus, you'll find out how Swift does away with pointer variables and how to reference and dereference variables instead",
