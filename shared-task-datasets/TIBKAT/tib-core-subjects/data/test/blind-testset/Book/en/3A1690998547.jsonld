            "abstract": "\"The aim of this book is to introduce the simulation of various physical fields and their applications for biomedical engineering, which will provide a base for researchers in the biomedical field to conduct further investigation. The entire book is classified into three levels. It starts with the first level, which presents the single physical fields including structural analysis, fluid simulation, thermal analysis, and acoustic modeling. Then, the second level consists of various couplings between two physical fields covering structural thermal coupling, porous media, fluid structural interaction (FSI), and acoustic FSI. The third level focuses on multi-coupling that coupling with more than two physical fields in the model. Each part in all levels is organized as the physical feature, finite element implementation, modeling procedure in ANSYS, and the specific applications for biomedical engineering like the FSI study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), acoustic wave transmission in the ear, and heat generation of the breast tumor. The book should help for the researchers and graduate students conduct numerical simulation of various biomedical coupling problems. It should also provide all readers with a better understanding of various couplings\"--",
