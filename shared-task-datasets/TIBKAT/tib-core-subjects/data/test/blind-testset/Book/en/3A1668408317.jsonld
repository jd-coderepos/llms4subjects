            "abstract": "\"Vehicle Scanning Method for Bridges is the first book on vehicle scanning the dynamic properties of bridges, written by the leading author on the subject. This vehicle scanning method (VSM) allows engineers to monitor every bridge of concern on a regular and routine basis, for the purpose of maintenance and damage detection. This method is efficient, economic and mobile in bridge health monitoring, compared with the conventional direct measurement approach. Vehicle Scanning Method for Bridges includes a review of the existing literature on the topic and presents the basic concept of extracting bridge frequencies from a moving test vehicle fitted with vibration sensors. How road surface roughness affects the vehicle scanning method is considered and a finite element simulation is conducted to demonstrate how surface roughness affects the vehicle response. Case studies and experimental results are also included\"--",
