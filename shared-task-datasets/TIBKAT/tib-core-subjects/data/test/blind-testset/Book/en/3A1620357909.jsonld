            "abstract": "\"Did you know that sometimes 2+2 equals 5? That wheels don't always have to be round? That you can mathematically prove there is a hippopotamus in your basement? Or how to spot four-dimensional beings as they pass through your kitchen? If not, then you need to read this book! Math Mutation Classics is a collection of Erik Seligman's blog articles from Math Mutation at MathMutation.com. Erik has been creating podcasts and converting them in his blog for many years. Now, he has collected what he believes to be the most interesting among them, and has edited and organized them into a book that is often thought provoking, challenging, and fun. This book is about using math in unique ways; of analyzing things we observe in life and using proof to attain the unexpected. There is quite a wide diversity of topics here and so all age levels and ability levels will enjoy the discussions. Erik's unique viewpoint puts a mathematical spin on everything from politicians to hippos. Along the way, you will enjoy the different point of view and hopefully it will open you up to a slightly more out-of-the-box way of thinking. What You Will Learn: To look at different problems in a different manner.Different ways of viewing the world.How mathematics can be applied to things you thought unimaginable.How to abstract things that are not taught in school. Who this book is for: The book is meant teens to geezers. It is great for teenagers and college level students who can gain from the many different ways of looking at problems and feed their interest in mathematics. Even mathematicians will enjoy the twists of point of view this book projects. Finally, it is for anyone with a bathroom.\" --Publisher's description",
