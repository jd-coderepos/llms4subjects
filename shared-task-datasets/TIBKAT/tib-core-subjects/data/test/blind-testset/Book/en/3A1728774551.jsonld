                "Given the exponential growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past few decades, AI and its related applications have become part of daily life in ways that we could never have dreamt of only a century ago. Our routines have been changed beyond measure by robotics and AI, which are now used in a vast array of services. Though AI is still in its infancy, we have already benefited immensely. This book introduces readers to basic Artificial Intelligence concepts, and helps them understand the relationship between AI and daily life. In the interest of clarity, the content is divided into four major parts. Part I (AI Concepts) presents fundamental concepts of and information on AI; while Part II (AI Technology) introduces readers to the five core AI Technologies that provide the building blocks for various AI applications, namely: Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining (DM), Computer Vision (CV), Natural Languages Processing (NLP), and Ontology-based Search Engine (OSE). In turn, Part III (AI Applications) reviews major contemporary applications that are impacting our ways of life, working styles and environment, ranging from intelligent agents and robotics to smart campus and smart city projects. Lastly, Part IV (Beyond AI) addresses related topics that are vital to the future development of AI. It also discusses a number of critical issues, such as AI ethics and privacy, the development of a conscious mind, and autonomous robotics in our daily lives. ."
