            "abstract": "The commercial operation of atmospheric water harvesting systems is still limited to few countries; this is mainly due to the low energy efficiency of the system and the inability to effectively operate throughout the various seasons of the year. Researchers have attempted to develop strategies to render the operation of atmospheric water harvesters easier and cost effective. This book covers work progress toward such direction, including among others the co-operation of these systems with renewable energy source and the adaptation of the systems to local conditions; the response of the communities around the world to such technology and how its implementation is affected by cultural believe, cost, and technological friendliness. The book is of interest to academic researchers, students, water authorities, professional in relevant industries, government regulatory bodies officers, and environmentalists.",
