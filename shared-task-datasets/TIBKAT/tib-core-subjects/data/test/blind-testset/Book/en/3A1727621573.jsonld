            "abstract": "The investigation of nanocrystalline materials has been an extremely active field during the past two decades as it promises to yield new and exciting properties, which will both test the scientific understanding of the behaviour of materials in general, and offer new scope for applications. While considerable progress has been made in basic understanding, the shift from fundamental science to technological application has been slow, especially with regard to exploitation of the mechanical behaviour of these materials. The approach taken in this review is to provide basic yet comprehensive accounts of (i) the processing and structure of nanostructured materials, with the emphasis on bulk materials, (ii) the underlying principles of relevant deformation mechanism, and (iii) the typical mechanical properties and behaviours of these materials when examined under laboratory conditions or in simulated operating environments. The review also points out those particular areas where scientific understanding and processing technology has advanced most, as well as those areas where further research is urgently required.This overview will be especially useful to any scientist or technologist, who is planning participate in the future of this exciting subject.1. Methods of Preparation - Typical Microstructures. 2. Theoretical Considerations and Modelling. 3. Experimental Studies of Mechanical Behaviour. 4. Conclusions. Provides accounts of the processing and structure of nanostructured materials, with emphasis on bulk materials; the underlying principles of relevant deformation mechanisms; and the typical mechanical properties and behaviors of these materials when examined under laboratory conditions or in simulated operating environments. Points out areas where scientific understanding has advanced most, as well as areas for further research. Contains chapters on methods of preparation and typical microstructures, theoretical considerations and modeling, and experimental studies of mechanical behavior.",
