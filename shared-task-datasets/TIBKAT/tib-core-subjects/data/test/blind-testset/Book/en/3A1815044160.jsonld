            "abstract": "\"The Counter-reformation path to natural philosophy was increasingly conditioned by its need to reconciliate the scholastic method with the experimental one, at the light of the evidence of new scientific and geographic discoveries. Official world-view was supported by approaches to knowledge such as the anti-superstitious discourse, which were based on the confluence of experimental, religious and legal methodologies in support of a more accurate interpretation of reality. La ciencia de Cervantes shows how selected cervantine texts, including the Quixote, Persiles and Sigismunda, and the Exemplary Novels, reflect how the confluence of artistic and scientific views of the period was evidenced in the depiction, among others, of exorcisms, animal-human interactions and geographical explorations. Particularly relevant is the case of the Colloquy of the Dogs, showing an attempt to reconciliate the confluence of Humanistic, Scholastic, anti-superstitious and baroque knowledge, in line with other unique Neoplatonist works, such as Maldonado's and Kepler's Somnium\"--",
