            "abstract": "\"Mechanics of Magnetostrictive Materials and Structures demonstrates the practical applications and uses for these cutting-edge smart materials. Exploring the analytical and numerical solution procedures and characteristics of metamaterials more generally, the book details how these respond to external factors. Exceptionally adjustable and adaptable, magnetostrictive materials are artificial structures that provide distinctive physical properties. Providing clear illustrations throughout, this book provides a comprehensive guide to the theory and its applications. Presenting the mathematical tools needed to analyse magnetostrictive materials and structures, through the use of MATLAB, the book will also detail static analysis. Comprehensively assessing the practicalities of these smart materials, it also discusses vibration and buckling under different loads, alongside dynamic behaviour. It includes MATLAB files for analytical and numerical simulations relevant to mechanics of magnetostrictive materials and presents vibration analysis of magnetostrictive materials and structures. The book demonstrates and analyses the effect of implementing boundary conditions on the mechanical responses of magnetostrictive structures and examines the use of smart materials in engineering structures. Aimed at students and professionals working in the field of mechanics, materials and dynamics, the book is an essential guide to this rapidly developing area\"--",
