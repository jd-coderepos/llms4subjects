            "title": "Polymer flooding",
            "abstract": "This book covers all aspects of polymer flooding, an enhanced oil recovery method using water soluble polymers to increase the viscosity of flood water, for the displacement of crude oil from porous reservoir rocks. Although this method is becoming increasingly important, there is very little literature available for the engineer wishing to embark on such a project. In the past, polymer flooding was mainly the subject of research. The results of this research are spread over a vast number of single publications, making it difficult for someone who has not kept up-to-date with developments during the last 10 to 15 years to judge the suitability of polymer flooding to a particular field case. This book tries to fill that gap. The basic mechanisms of the process are described and criteria given where it may be employed. Basic elements of the chemistry of EOR-polymers are provided. The fundamentals of polymer physics, such as rheology, flow in porous media and adsorption, are derived. Practical hints on mixing and testing of polymers in the laboratory are given, as well as instructions for their application in the oil field. Polymer flooding is illustrated by some case histories and the economics of the methods are examined. For the essential subjects, example calculations are added. An indispensable book for reservoir engineers, production engineers and laboratory technicians within the petroleum industry",
