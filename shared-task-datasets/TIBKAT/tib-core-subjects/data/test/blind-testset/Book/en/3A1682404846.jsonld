            "abstract": "\"A resounding masterpiece of architectural publishing, this volume, Rizzoli's sixth on Morphosis and its founder, architect Thom Mayne, features the work of the award-winning interdisciplinary architectural and design practice over the past fourteen years. Known for its architecture of complexity, disruption, and ambiguity, Morphosis is on the cutting edge of exploration and discovery in design. Sometimes on the border of controversy with daring vision and provocative large-scale urban projects, the firm continually invites us to question what architecture is and can be while remaining sensitive to its central purpose--to provide safe, sheltering spaces for life, work, and play. This book documents the great variety of the firm's creations across the globe, from an innovative public-housing complex in Madrid and a courthouse in Oregon to the San Francisco Federal Building, a new academic building for the Cooper Union in New York, the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Texas, the new EOS Towers in Kuala Lumpur, and the Sejong M-Bridge, in Sejong City, South Korea. Like the architecture of this trailblazing firm, the book is an exhilarating demonstration of visual excitement, bold graphics, and innovative design.\"--Provided by publisher",
