                "\"In semiconductor manufacturing, understanding how various materials behave and interact is critical to making a reliable and robust semiconductor package. Semiconductor Packaging: Materials Interaction and Reliability provides a fundamental understanding of the underlying physical properties of the materials used in a semiconductor package. The book focuses on an important step in semiconductor manufacturing package assembly and testing. It covers the basics of material properties and explains how to determine which behaviors are important to package performance. The authors also discuss how the properties of packaging materials interact with each another and explore how to maximize the performance of these materials in regard to package integrity and reliability.By tying together the disparate elements essential to a semiconductor package, this easy-to-read book shows how all the parts fit and work together to provide durable protection for the integrated circuit chip within as well as a means for the chip to communicate with the outside world\"--",
                "\"Preface Semiconductor packaging assembly and test is an important manufacturing step necessary to create electronic products. The subject is not understood in much depth, as compared to a subject like circuit design. It is generally believed that this is due to the nature of the topic, as back-end processing of semiconductors is a multidisciplinary area, encompassing materials science, mechanical design, electrical layout and modeling, and many other engineering specialties. This book specifically addresses that shortcoming, especially in the area of materials used for packaging semiconductors and their interactions. Simply put, semiconductor packages are not monolithic entities but are made up of many different components interlocked with the common goal of protecting the integrated circuit while allowing it to communicate with the outside world--the lead frame or substrate on which the chip sits upon, the die attach adhesive to glue the chip down, electrical connections made via metallic bonding wires or bond pad bumps for flip chip attachment, and finally an epoxy molding compound to encapsulate everything for protection. And, those components are made up of very different materials: polymers, composites, metals, and various combinations of those categories. Understanding how the various materials behave and interact as they form the protective barrier for the delicate chip is key for making the package reliable and robust. To gain these insights, a basic knowledge of material properties is necessary, along with determining which behaviors are important to package performance. That takes understanding how a given property is measured and why it is significant\"--"
