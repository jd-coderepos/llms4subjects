                "The German edition of this book, first published in 1966, has been quite popular; we did not, however, consider publishing an English edition because a number of excellent textbooks in this field already exist. In recent years, how\u00ad ever, the wish was frequently expressed that, especially, the description of the relationships between optimization and other subfields of mathematics, which is not to be found in this form in other texts, might be made available to a wider readership; so it was with this in mind that, be\u00ad latedly, a translation was undertaken after all. Since the appearance of the German edition, the field of optimization has continued to develop at an unabated rate. A completely current presentation would have required a total reworking of the book; unfortunately, this was not possible. For example, we had to ignore the extensive progress which has been made in the development of numerical methods which do not require convexity assumptions to find local maxima and minima of non-linear optimization problems. These methods are also applicable to boundary value, and other, problems. Many new results, both of a numerical and a theoretical na\u00ad ture, which are especially relevant to applications, are to be found in the areas of optimal contol and integer optimiza\u00ad tion.",
