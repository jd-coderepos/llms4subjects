            "abstract": "\"Mathematicians and scientists frequently say that math - algebra in particular -- is beautiful. But the rest of us may not see it that way - and who can blame us? After all, if your childhood memories of math are mostly about anxiety and frustration, it can feel like the \"true beauty\" of math must be reserved for mathematicians and geniuses of the highest caliber. Award-winning mathematics professor Gerald Williams is here to change that. Algebra the Beautiful is a journey into the theoretical heart of elementary math that proves just how big, dramatic, and relevant this discipline really is. Drawing from 25 years of teaching mathematics to liberal arts students, Williams blends metaphor, history, and storytelling with numbers and equations to bring the hidden grandeur of his subject into view. Williams doesn't ignore the obvious practical applications of algebra, delving into how we use it to think about motion and to reckon with the unknown and the unpredictable. At the same time, he shows readers how to think of algebra the same way they might think about a symphony or a painting. Yes, to create one, you must know how to use brushes and paints, or how violins or clarinets sound on their own. But to appreciate them - to enjoy them - you are better off learning how the parts work together to create a wonderful whole. Whether you're a teacher looking to make math come alive for your students; a parent hoping to get your children engaged and ahead; a student trying to come to terms with a sometimes bewildering subject; or just a lover of mathematics, this book has something for you. Gerald Williams shows all of us how we can grasp the beauty and harmony of algebra\"--",
