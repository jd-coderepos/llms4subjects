            "abstract": "\"The interaction of our bodies in space is intrinsically linked to the ways in which we design. In spatial design we tend to focus on solely the visual, often treating it as the dominant sense while ignoring the other four senses: touch, sound, smell, taste. While research has been carried out on the perception of multisensorial experiences and design in the last two decades, there is no combined resource on how to address multisensory design in landscape architecture, architecture, urban and environmental design. This is a textbook for design students, professionals, and educators to develop multisensorial literacy. This book is the first of its kind, providing introductions on each of the five senses, along with exercises that demonstrate how to observe, record, and visualize them. It explores current design school pedagogy, and how we might imagine a more mindful way of teaching. The book is a foundational resource for students, professionals, and instructors to understand and ultimately create multisensorial spaces that are inclusive for all. This book imagines a world where seeing is redefined in a way that encompasses all of the senses-not just the visual\"--",
