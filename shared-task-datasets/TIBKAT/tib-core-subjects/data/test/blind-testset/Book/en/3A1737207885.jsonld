            "abstract": "\"This informative volume provides comprehensive knowledge on various aspects of wastewater resource management from the point of process sustainability and resource recovery. This authoritative compendium is crucial for developing resource-efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment technologies and management strategies for both small (decentralized) and large (centralized) communities. Traditional wastewater systems have become increasingly energy-consuming and cost-intensive while also not meeting the increasing standards for nutrient removal and sustainable development. This book incorporates the latest developments in pollutant removal and resource recovery schemes in wastewater treatment. It highlights advances that have been made in microbiological processes; design of treatment methods; process configurations ; energy conservation and efficiency improvement schemes ; nutrient removal; recovery, reclamation, and recycling ; beneficial uses of wastewater ; and bioenergy and biochemical production from wastewater and sludge streams. Waste-to-energy technologies, especially wastewater treatment as a potential biofuel energy alternative through bioelectrochemical and other processes, are also discussed in this book. Basic and advanced principles of wastewater treatment are covered with theoretical development, illustrations, samples and examples, and case studies. Eminent scholars around the world have shared their knowledge here, making this volume a valuable resource for novice researchers as well as practicing and experienced professionals in biofuel research and industrial sectors. The scientific experimental methods and analytical procedures and interpretation of the results capture the state-of-the-art knowledge in the literature and future trends in this area\"--",
