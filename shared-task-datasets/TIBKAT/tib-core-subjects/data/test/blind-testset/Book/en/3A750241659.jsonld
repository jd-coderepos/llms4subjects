            "abstract": "\"The purpose of the Safety Recommendations contained in this publication is to provide information on the design, construction, equipment, training and protection of the crews of small fishing vessels with a view to promoting the safety of the vessel and the safety and health of the crews. The Safety Recommendations may also serve as a guide for those concerned with the safety of vessels used in support of aquaculture activities. They are not intended as a substitute for national laws and regulations but may serve as a guide to those persons concerned with framing such national laws and regulations. Unless otherwise stated, the provisions of the Safety Recommendations are intended to apply to new decked vessels of less than 12 m in length and new undecked vessels intended to operate at sea (as well as on oceans, rivers, lakes and dams, or on any body of water). Nevertheless, even where not otherwise stated, the competent authority should as far as reasonable and practical give consideration to the application of these provisions to existing vessels.\"--Page iv",
