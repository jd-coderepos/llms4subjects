            "abstract": "Learn JavaFX 8 shows you how to start developing rich-client desktop applications using your Java skills and provides comprehensive coverage of JavaFX 8's features. Each chapter starts with an introduction to the topic at hand, followed by a step-by-step discussion of the topic with small snippets of code. The book contains numerous figures aiding readers in visualizing the GUI that is built at every step in the discussion. The book starts with an introduction to JavaFX and its history. It lists the system requirements and the steps to start developing JavaFX applications. It shows you how to create a Hello World application in JavaFX, explaining every line of code in the process. Later in the book, author Kishori Sharan discusses advanced topics such as 2D and 3D graphics, charts, FXML, advanced controls, and printing. Some of the advanced controls such as TableView, TreeTableView and WebView are covered at length in separate chapters. This book provides complete and comprehensive coverage of JavaFX 8 features; uses an incremental approach to teach JavaFX, assuming no prior GUI knowledge; includes code snippets, complete programs, and pictures; covers MVC patterns using JavaFX; and covers advanced topics such as FXML, effects, transformations, charts, images, canvas, audio and video, DnD, and more. So, after reading and using this book, you'll come away with a comprehensive introduction to the JavaFX APIs as found in the new Java 8 platform",
