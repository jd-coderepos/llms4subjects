            "abstract": "This textbook shows all the existing knowledge about coastal geology and its implications for coastal management. In the last decades, the geological sciences have been supplying exciting information about the coastal systems, not only from its dynamics but also providing a sedimentary concept to understand and interpret the preserved coastal stratigraphical record. Furthermore, recent investigations have been focused on the prevention of coastal hazards like storms, tsunamis, or sea-level fluctuation. This discipline has an increasing interest after the expanding human activities around the coasts worldwide. The present trend is that many of the problems raised by the coast\u2013human interaction must be resolved by using the Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The chapters of this book have a double-level structure. The first part of each chapter contains the necessary information for undergraduate courses studying coastal geology. The second part includes advanced information and examples to be used by graduate students and novel professionals.",
