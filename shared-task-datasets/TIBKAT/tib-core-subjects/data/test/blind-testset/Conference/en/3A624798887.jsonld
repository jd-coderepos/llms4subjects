            "abstract": "\"W22 Software Engineering Challenges of Cloud Computing: Cloud Computing as a new paradigm for deploying and managing services on large distributed infrastructures poses interesting challenges for both academic and industrial research. In this workshop we would like to challenge researchers and practitioners to think about various aspects of cloud computing. First, to avoid the pitfalls of heterogeneous programming paradigms, what are the software engineering challenges that will face developers who target the cloud as their production environment to offer services? Second, how is cloud computing going to face the challenges around soaring service management costs. Third, what are the new business models for services that could optimally leverage the cloud economy of scale.\"--Http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/workshops",
