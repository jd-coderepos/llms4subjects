                "This book consists of papers presented at AUTOMATION2019, an international conference held in Warsaw from March 27 to 29, 2019. It discusses the radical technological changes occurring due to the INDUSTRY 4.0. To follow these changes, both scientists and engineers have to face the challenge of interdisciplinary approach directed at the development of cyber-physical systems. This approach encompasses interdisciplinary theoretical knowledge, numerical modelling and simulation as well as application of artificial intelligence techniques. Both software and physical devices are composed into systems that will increase production efficiency and resource savings. The theoretical results, practical solutions and guidelines presented are valuable for both researchers working in the area of engineering sciences and practitioners looking for solutions to industrial problems",
