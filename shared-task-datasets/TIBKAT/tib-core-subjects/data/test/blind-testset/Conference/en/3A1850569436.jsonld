            "abstract": "This book is an ideal and practical resource on the potential impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) can have in space sciences and applications. AI for Space Application presents a hands-on approach to browse in the subject and to learning how to do.  AI is not yet fully accepted as a pervasive technology in space applications because they are often mission-critical and the cost of space equipment and modules raises skepticism on any practical use and reliability. However, it is evident that its potential impact on many aspects is dramatic. Starting from either actual or experimental realizations, the book accompanies the reader through such fascinating subjects like space exploration, autonomous navigation and landing, rover control and guidance on rough surfaces, image analysis automation for planet or star classification, and for space debris avoidance without human intervention. This kind of approach may facilitate further investigations on the same or similar subjects, as the future of space explorations is going toward adopting AI.   The intended audience of the book are researchers from academia and space industries and practitioners in related start-ups",
