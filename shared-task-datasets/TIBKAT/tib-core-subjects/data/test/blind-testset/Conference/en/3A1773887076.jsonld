                "Oaxaca, Mexico, was the place chosen by a large international group of scientists to meet and discuss on the recent advances on the understanding of the physical prop- ties of low dimensional systems; one of the most active fields of research in condensed matter in the last years. The International Symposium on the Physics of Low Dim- sions took place in January 16-20, 2000. The group of scientists converging into the historical city of Oaxaca, in the state of the same name, had come from Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, several places in Mexico, Canada, U. S. A. , England, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. The presentations at the workshop provided sta- of-art reviews of many of the most important problems, currently under study. Equally important to all the participants in the workshop was the fact that we had come to honor a friend, Hans Christoph Siegmann, on his sixty-fifth birthday. This Festschrift recognizes the intellectual leadership of Professor Siegmann in the field and as a sincere homage to his qualities as an exceptional friend, college and mentor. Those who have had the privilege to work closely with Hans Christoph have been deeply impressed by his remarkable analytic mind as well as by his out of range kindness and generosity. Hans Christoph has contributed to the understanding of the difficult and very important problem of the magnetic properties of finite systems: surfaces, thin films, heterostructures.",
