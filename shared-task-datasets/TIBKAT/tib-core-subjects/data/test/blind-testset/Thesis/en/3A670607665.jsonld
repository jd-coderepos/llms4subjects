            "abstract": "Glandular chemical defense of Chrysomelina larvae is either, not (iridoids), in part, or completely dependent (salicylaldehyde) on host derived glucosides. After uptake of glucoside precursors into the glandular reservoir, deglucosylation and further modification to defensive compounds falls into line. In case of iridoid and salicylaldehyde formation deglucosylation is followed by a common oxidation step, which led to assume a single origin of the oxidases in those species. Salicylaldehyde producers Chrysomela spp. and P. vitellinae are adapted to sequester the phytogenic precursor salicin and therefore are restricted to feed on salicaceous hosts. Whereas this host plant specialization may have favored salicin-based defense and stabilized salicyl alcohol oxidase (SAO) activity in Chrysomelina, shift to Betulaceae within the genus Chrysomela negatively affected the fate of salicylaldehyde formation. SAO transcripts and genes have been identified in C. lapponica and P. vitellinae. Additionally, SAO related sequences were found in iridoid producing species. But the corresponding protein in the defensive secretion and its specific SAO activity verified after heterologous expression followed by in vitro enzyme assays are only present in salicylaldehyde producers...",
