            "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with an optimal control problem, arising from the optimization of the temperature distribution within the sublimation growth of semiconductor single-crystals. The problem consists of a semilinear elliptic partial differential equation with nonlocal radiation interface conditions and pointwise control and state constraints. It is treated by two different approaches: First, a semilinear optimal control problem with monotone nonlinearity and pointwise state constraints is considered. It is known that the Lagrange multipliers associated to the pointwise state constraints are in general regular Borel measures. This lack of regularity leads to theoretical and numerical challenges. However, by using a Larentiev-type regularization, the problem can be transformed to a control-constrained optimization problem, that provides regular Lagrange multipliers. In the linear-quadratic case, it is possible to prove strong convergence of the solutions of the regularized problems to the solution of the original problem for regularization parameter tending to zero. This result is confirmed by numerical observations. The second part of this thesis deals with a purely control-constrained optimal control problem that accounts for the non-monotone nonlinearity caused by the nonlocal radiation interface conditions. Using Brezi's theorem for pseudomonotone operators, one proves the unique existence of solutions of the semilinear state equation. Moreover, based on Stampacchia's truncation method, the boundedness of the solutions is shown ...",
