            "title": "Trace gas fluxes and belowground carbon allocation in tropical montane forest soils of Southern Ecuador",
            "abstract": "Tropical forest soils are important sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and of nitric oxide (NO), a precursor of ozone production. They are also sinks for the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Estimates on soil trace gas fluxes and on carbon cycling from tropical forest soils are heavily biased towards lowland forests. Limited data is available on trace gas exchange from tropical montane forest (TMF) soils and their carbon cycle has only been marginally explored, although TMFs cover approximately 9% of the tropical forest area. This dissertation presents the results of a comprehensive study on soil CO2, N2O, NO, and CH4 exchange and possible biogeochemical regulators, with a special focus on the influence of nutrient availability in TMFs of southern Ecuador. Soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes were determined using static closed chambers and gas chromatographic analysis at three sites along an elevation gradient from 1000 m to 3000 m (1000 m, 2000 m, 3000 m) and along topographic gradients (lower slope, midslope, ridge),. NO fluxes were measured in the field using open dynamic chambers and a LMA-3D NO2 Analyzer with chemiluminescence detection. To determine the potential atmospheric CH4 uptake of different soil substrates, a laboratory incubation experiment using organic ...",
