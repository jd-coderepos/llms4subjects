            "title": "Designing Urban National Memory",
            "abstract": "The study of memory, architecture, and urban space has been the interest of researchers from the diverse fields around the world due to, the significance of dealing with memories especially after the tragedy of the Second World War. Nations in Europe has chosen not to neglect their past, moreover, overcoming it by strengthening the national identity. An approach was clear in the literature, art, further in the way of rebuilding their cities; that mainly has reflected on the value of urban spaces and their role in narrating the country\u2019s national memory. Thanks to this approach, which has supported the post-war European nations to invite to an act of forgiveness rather than to forget. On the contrary, memory, in relation to architecture is a form of knowledge has been neglected in Egypt, especially during the previous decades after the declaration of independence from the colonial power, and since 1952 revolution. Recently, a rising debate about Egypt national history and the need to renationalize the Egyptian historical consciousness has rapidly grown up, due to the political transformation has occurred because of the 25th uprising, 2011, which unveiled the power of public spaces in constituting the nation thoughts, especially Tahrir square.At the same time, this has unveiled the results of neglecting the past instead of overcoming it; unveiled a present carries the danger of conflict and repeating previous mistakes. Researchers, historians, politicians, governmental organization, have worked in the purpose of revisiting the historical information, and have tried to document the current transformation of the 25th uprising. There was a public demand for redesigning Tahrir square to reflect the memory of the uprising as a symbol of the power of the public. However, after eight years, those memories have faded as if the 25th uprising has never happened. Those circumstances are very relevant to the gap between urban design and the art of memory-work, in the scientific field. Few studies in Egypt conducted the concept of memory in relation to urban spaces, however, the matter requires more attention, to associate the need for renationalizing Egypt memory, with viewing urban space as a mean of narrating the country\u2019s national memory and reflecting the citizens' current thoughts, as a try of nearing the distances between competing narratives. Therefore, the research aims at developing a methodological framework that should contribute to renationalizing memory through urban space. Further, benefiting from the German experience by investigating lessons to learn. That is based on the hypothesis that, although there is no fixed formula for all countries to renationalize the historical consciousness of memory through urban spaces, lessons to be learned from Germany experience could be a driving dimension when designing Egyptian urban spaces with a concept of memory as an essential factor. To guide the validity of the study\u2019s hypothesis, a set of research questions are thus formulated: Starting from why memory is an essential factor when designing urban spaces? Regarding Egypt national memory, how it was constituted through history and how to read its representation on urban spaces? Also, the study quests the means of nationalizing memory through urban spaces? And What are the learned lessons from the German experience? The study tries to answer those questions. Via an inductive analytical methodology which moves from the gap of knowledge and from a particular situation in Egypt, to study the German experience in renationalizing the concept of memory through urban spaces. Within the scope of the study, exploring Egypt prevailing narratives and the inherited concepts which influenced the national memory is essential. Moreover, the research develops analytical political psychosocial model that could help reading memories in urban spaces, memory\u2019s actors, and memory influences. To validate this model, case studies are analysed in light of the concluded aspects. Consequently, the expected result is to infer broad general learned lessons for the Egyptian case. Research findings and conclusions answer the research questions, interpret literature review, recommend some guide points to three target groups: first, practice field; to encourage designers to value the national and collective memories when designing urban spaces. Second, to ask policymakers to take the public participation into consideration, when taking decisions related to urban development. Third, the thesis recommends future researches of urban memory that connect theoretical information with the practice field. Finally, enhancing the memory-work in relation to the national narrative, conveying a meaningful message, when designing urban spaces could encourage citizens to learn, to interact, and to dissolve boundaries between the competing narratives in post-conflict societies.",
