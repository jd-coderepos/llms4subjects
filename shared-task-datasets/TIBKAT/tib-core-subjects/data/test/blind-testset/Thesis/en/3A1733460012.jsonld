            "abstract": "One of the tremendous discoveries by the Cassini spacecraft has been the detection of propeller structures in Saturn's A ring. Although the generating moonlet is too small to be resolved by the cameras aboard Cassini, its produced density structure within the rings, caused by its gravity can be well observed. The largest observed propeller is called Bl\u00e9riot and has an azimuthal extent over several thousand kilometers. Thanks to its large size, Bl\u00e9riot could be identified in different images over a time span of over 10 years, allowing the reconstruction of its orbital evolution. It turns out that Bl\u00e9riot deviates considerably from its expected Keplerian orbit in azimuthal direction by several thousand kilometers. This excess motion can be well reconstructed by a superposition of three harmonics, and therefore resembles the typical fingerprint of a resonantly perturbed body. This PhD thesis is directed to the excess motion of Bl\u00e9riot. Resonant perturbations are a known for some of the outer satellites of Saturn. Thus, in the first part ...",
