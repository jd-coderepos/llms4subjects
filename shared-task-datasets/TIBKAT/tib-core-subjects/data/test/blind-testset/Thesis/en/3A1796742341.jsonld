                "The layer-by-layer method is a robust way of surface functionalization using a wide range of materials, e.g. synthetic and natural polyelectrolytes (PEs), proteins and nanoparticles. Thus, this method yields films with applications in diverse areas including biology and medicine. Sequential adsorption of different oppositely charged macromolecules can be used to prepare tailored films with controlled molecular organization. In biomedical research, electrically conductive coatings are of interest. In manuscript 1, we investigated films sequentially assembled from the polycation poly (diallyldimethyl-ammonium) (PDADMA) and modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with CNTs serving as the electrically conductive material. We assume that charge transport occurs through CNT contacts. We showed that with more than four CNT/PDADMA bilayers, the electrical conductivity is constant and independent of the number of CNT/PDADMA bilayers. A conductivity up to 4\u221910^3 S/m was found. It is possible to control the conductivity with the CNT concentration of the CNT deposition suspension. A higher CNT concentration resulted in thicker CNT/PDADMA bilayers, but in a lower conductivity per bilayer. We suspect that an increased CNT concentration leads to a rapid CNT adsorption without the possibility to rearrange themselves. If PDADMA then adsorbs on the disordered CNTs in the next deposition step, the average thickness of the polymer layer is thicker than on the more ordered CNT layer from the dilute ..."
