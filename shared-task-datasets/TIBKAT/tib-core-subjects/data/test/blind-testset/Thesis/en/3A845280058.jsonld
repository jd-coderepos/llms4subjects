                "Evolutionary morphology not only aims at describing but explaining morphological diversity. Sperm in general and spider sperm in particular are known for their enormous morphological diversity. Additionally, spider sperm are transferred coiled and encapsulated, thus surrounded by a secretion sheath. Moreover, sperm are not only transferred as individual sperm but as sperm conjugates. Synspermia, where several sperm entirely fuse at the end of spermiogenesis are characteristic of a specific spider taxon, the so-called Synspermiata. The present thesis is focused on the sperm diversity of dysderoid spiders, a well-defined clade within Synspermiata. Dysderoidea consist of four families, namely Segestriidae, Dysderidae, Orsolobidae and Oonopidae, with Caponiidae as supoosed sister group to the latter. Sperm conjugates of certain Orsolobidae and Oonopidae, as well as a representative of Caponiidae are not surrounded by secretion sheath. The function of the secretion sheath is not yet clear. However, before sperm become activated the secretion sheath needs to be removed inside the female genital system, a process that is likely controlled by the female. Thus, unsheathed sperm conjugates might represent a male mating strategy to bypass the influence of the female and overcome a certain female choice. The sperm morphological diversity within Dysderoidea is especially high in Oonopidae. Here e.g., aflagellate sperm, as well as uncoiled sperm are transferred by certain oonopid taxa ..."
