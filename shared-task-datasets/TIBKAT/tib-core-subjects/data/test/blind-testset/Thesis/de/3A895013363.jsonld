                "In the past decades, eutrophication led to an unsatisfying ecological state of several coastal lagoons around the Baltic Sea, resulting e. g. in extensive harmfull algae blooms. In freshwaters, submerged macrophytes were used to improve the ecological state of lakes or rivers. For example, macrophytes directly reduce water turbidity as they promote sedimentation of suspended matter and limit resuspension of sediment. They also provide zooplankton a refuge against predators. As zooplankton graze on phytoplankton, macrophytes indirectly promote reduction of phytoplankton biomass and therefore, reduce water turbidity. It might be possible that these feedback mechanisms are less effective in brackish waters, as e. g. zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton is less efficient due to a different species composition and a higher mortality of zooplankton caused by fishes and invertebrates within macrophyte stands. In the present thesis, interactions between submerged macrophytes and their biotic and abiotic environment were determined in two shallow brackish coastal lagoon systems located in the southern Baltic Sea: Vitter Bodden (macrophyte-dominated, mesotrophic) and Darss-Zingster-Bodden chain (DZBC, phytoplankton-dominated, eutrophic to heavily eutrophic). The effects of submerged vegetation on the ecological status of the two studied brackish lagoon systems were discussed. To analyse the interactions between submerged macrophytes and their abiotic and biotic environment, the ..."
