(I) For application of a genetically engineered virus under field conditions, knowledge about its genetic stability is mandatory. Therefore, the genetic stability of \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d needed to be assessed in vivo and in vitro. Mutation rates were compared to the parental pestivirus strains (BVDV-1 \u201cCP7\u201d and CSFV \u201cAlfort/187\u201d), and BVDV or CSFV field-strains. There was no indication that \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d could be more prone to mutational events than its parental viruses or representative field-strains. Moreover, no recombination events were observed in in vitro experiments. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study confirm a strong genetic stability of \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d as an important safety component. (II) Since vaccination of breeding animals is often discussed, this study was conducted to assess the safety of \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d vaccination of breeding male pigs. The study with \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d vaccinated boar demonstrated that the new CSFV marker vaccine is suitable for application in reproductive boar. Neither in organs of the uro-genital tract related to sperm production nor in urine or feces, vaccine virus genome was detectable. Dissemination of \u201cCP7_E2alf\u201d through semen, and shedding with urine and feces, is therefore highly unlikely. (III) In order to ..."
