                "Computer Aided Architectural Design CAAD, future of architectural design, virtual architecture, virtual reality environment; the results presented in this book are first steps in the direction of virtual an 'bits and bricks' architecture. The researchers, teachers and students who developed the ideas presented in this book were mostly architects or computer scientists who worked in an environment dominated by architectural discourse.",
                "Verlagsinfo: \"Bits and Spaces\" presents 33 exciting new projects which demonstrate the growing significance of CAAD for today's architects. Divided into 5 main chapters: Design in Space and Time; Learning and Creative Collaboration; Virtual Environments; IT and Practice; and Blurring Boundaries, the projects illustrate how computers can be used innovatively and creatively in designing physical, virtual and hybrid architecture. Particular emphasis is placed on the interaction between man and computer, and also on the aesthetic aspects. The book is accompanied by a CD-Rom which documents the design processes through animation sequences, demonstrating the dynamic features of the projects. Whilst these tools, installations and multi-media projects have arisen out of the field of architecture, they exceed the narrow confines of this discipline to touch upon areas such as interior design, graphic design and information technology."
