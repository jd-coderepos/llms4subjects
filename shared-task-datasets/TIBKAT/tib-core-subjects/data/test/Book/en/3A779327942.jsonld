                "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design for Information Systemsclearly explains real object-oriented programming in practice. Expert author Raul Sidnei Wazlawick explains concepts such as object responsibility, visibility and the real need for delegation in detail. The object-oriented code generated by using these concepts in a systematic way is concise, organized and reusable. The patterns and solutions presented in this book are based in research and industrial applications. You will come away with clarity regarding processes and use cases and a clear understand of how to expand a use case. Wazlawick clearly explains clearly how to build meaningful sequence diagrams. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design for Information Systemsillustrates how and why building a class model is not just placing classes into a diagram. You will learn the necessary organizational patterns so that your software architecture will be maintainable.Learn how to build better class models, which are more maintainable and understandable. Write use cases in a more efficient and standardized way, using more effective and less complex diagrams. Build true object-oriented code with division of responsibility and delegation.",
