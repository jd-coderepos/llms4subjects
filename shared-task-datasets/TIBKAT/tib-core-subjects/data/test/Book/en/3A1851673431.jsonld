            "abstract": "\"This text demystifies the subject by using a simple and step-by-step approach, from fundamentals to modern concepts of traditional uniprocessor operating systems, in addition to advanced operating systems on various multiple-processor platforms and also real-time operating systems (RTOSs). While projecting an insight into the generic operating systems of today, its primary objective is to integrate the concepts, techniques, and case studies into cohesive chapters that finally locate the bridges formed with a reasonable balance between theoretical design issues and practical implementation details. It addresses most of the issues required to be resolved in the design and development of continuously evolving rich diversified modern operating systems, and describes successful implementation approaches in the form of abstract models and algorithms. This book is primarily intended for use in any discipline of undergraduate courses and also for a substantial portion of the post-graduate course that include the subject, Operating system. It can also be equally used for self-study\"--",
