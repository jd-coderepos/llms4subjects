            "abstract": "\"An extraordinary illustrated history of the National Marine Sanctuary system and a guide to its fourteen protected underwater locations  This book tells the story of fourteen underwater places so important they are under special protection, together forming the US National Marine Sanctuary System. These sanctuaries, spanning more than 620,000 square miles and ranging from the Florida Keys to the Great Lakes to the Hawaiian Islands, are critical, breathtaking marine habitats that provide homes to endangered and threatened species. They also preserve America's rich maritime heritage and act as living laboratories for science, research, education, and conservation and offer outdoor recreation experiences for all ages. The unique waters of the National Marine Sanctuary System are extensive and valuable refuges, and this book celebrates their importance, diversity, and beauty.  Through 175 full-color photographs and lively narrative, American Seas showcases each of the marine sanctuaries and underscores how they have shaped the nation's development, survival, and identity. It also explores how marine conservation differs from, and is in some ways more challenging than, conservation on land. The book celebrates these underwater treasures, now protected and preserved, for all they can tell us about our communities, our country, and our world\"--",
