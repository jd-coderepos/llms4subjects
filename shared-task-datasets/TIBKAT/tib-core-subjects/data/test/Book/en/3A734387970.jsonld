This invaluable new compendium of spectacular houses designed by architecture's brightest stars also provides unique insights into their personal design philosophies. Stunning architectural photography of each house is supplemented with detailed descriptions, plans, sections, and sketches, revealing the mastery behind each design. Project locations range from the USA to France, from Italy to Dubai, and from Hong Kong to Spain",
