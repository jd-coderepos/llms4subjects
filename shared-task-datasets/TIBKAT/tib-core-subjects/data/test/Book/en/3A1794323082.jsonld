            "abstract": "\"Looking at the never-ending understanding of plant-microbe interactions, it is indispensable to keep track of research scenario. This field have been inferred using numerous approaches based on the aims of the researchers in various disciplines. However, the emergence of next-generation techniques, both molecular and computational have brought new face to the research. These approaches often result in massive information, which are sometimes tangled and need further analysis. These types of analyses also require cutting-edge data analytics as well as efficient statistical models. Plant-Microbe Interactions: Harnessing Next-Generation Molecular Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture provides a wholesome idea regarding the modern-day analytics and approaches being used to provide insights into the interactions between plant and microbe. A wide range of technologies have been explored along with practical guides towards these techniques. A detailed understanding of omics data in various areas could be obtained from this compilation. Features:  Cross-talk between plant and microbe  Overview of advanced molecular techniques particular to study plant-microbe interaction  Practical guide to technologies such as NGS  Omics data analysis particular to study plant-microbe interaction  Role of Soil Metagenomics  Advanced technologies such as Nanotech and CRISPR serving plant-microbe interaction This book will serve as a great reference to various next-generation techniques in the field of plant-microbe interaction, thereby, helping in understanding the mechanisms better. This will also help the budding researchers to shape their research in similar area\"--",
