            "title": "Newton and modern physics",
            "abstract": "\"This book looks at how Newton's theories can be linked to modern day problems and solutions in physics. Newton created an abstract system of theorizing which has been applied to all aspects of the physical world, however he had difficulties in persuading his contemporaries of its unique merits. A detailed study of Newton's writings, published and unpublished, suggests that he had an almost archetypally powerful mode of thinking guaranteed to produce 'correct' results even in areas of physics where systematic study only began long after his time. Newton and Modern Physics investigates this phenomena, looking at examples of where Newton's principles have relevance to modern day thinking -- the study of Newton's work in both seventeenth century and present-day contexts helps to enhance our understanding of both. Published by World Scientific as the first of a three-part set for Newtonian scholars, historians of science, philosophers of science and others interested in Newtonian physics, the other titles are Newton and the Great World System and Newton and Controversy, by Peter Rowlands, (2017)\"--",
