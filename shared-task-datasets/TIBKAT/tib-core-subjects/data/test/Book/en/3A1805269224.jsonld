            "abstract": "\"Research shows that access to nature, big classroom windows, and open campuses along active streets reduce stress, anxiety, disorderly conduct, and crime. Yet, too many American public schools look and feel like prisons. They are designed out of fear of vandalism, truancy, and added maintenance costs. Despite decades of research demonstrating the benefits of restorative school environments for students' mental, physical, and academic success, they aren't yet part of mainstream conversations about mental health and wellbeing, or school planning, design, maintenance, and safety. Restorative school environments can invite and build a broad community around our children and adolescents; improve the quality of the neighborhood; reduce students' anxiety and aggression; and make them feel safer, more hopeful, and whole. Schools That Heal explains the compelling connections between human health and school design, and look at how investing in school design elements-large and small- that promote health can positively impact both students and the entire community, promoting resilience and environmental justice\"--",
