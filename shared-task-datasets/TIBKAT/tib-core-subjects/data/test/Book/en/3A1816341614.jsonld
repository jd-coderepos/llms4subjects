            "title": "Side-channel analysis of embedded systems : an efficient algorithmic approach",
            "abstract": "It has been more than 20 years since the seminal publications on side-channel attacks. They aim at extracting secrets from embedded systems while they execute cryptographic algorithms, and they consist of two steps, measurement and analysis. This useful textbook/guide tackles the analysis part, especially under situations where the targeted device is protected by random masking. The book advances in the field and provides the reader with mathematical formalizations. Furthermore, it presents all known analyses within the same notation framework, thereby allowing the reader to rapidly understand and learn contrasting approaches. The examples presented are taken from real-world datasets. This unique text/reference will be useful as a higher-level introduction to the topic, as well as for self-study by researchers and professionals needing a concise guidebook. Maamar Ouladj is an expert in embedded systems security, currently working in Algiers, Algeria. Sylvain Guilley is general manager and chief technical officer at Secure-IC S.A.S., currently working in Paris, France.",
