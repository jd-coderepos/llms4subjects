                "Serving as a general introduction to surface and interface science, this book focuses on basic concepts rather than specific details, on intuitive understanding rather than learning facts. The text reflects that physics and chemistry of surfaces is a diverse field of research which involves classical scientific and engineering disciplines. Fundamentals subject like thermodynamics of interfaces as well as applied topics such as wetting, friction, and lubrication are discussed.The most important techniques and methods are introduced. Readers will be able to apply simple models to their own scientific problems. Furthermore, manifold high end technological applications are shown parallel with the basic scientific treatment, e.g. AFM, surface technology, biotechnology, microelectronics, biomaterials.The authors address advanced students of chemistry, physics, materials science, chemical engineering and related subjects with a basic knowledge of natural sciences and mathematics. Also scientists and engineers who are not yet specialists in surface science but want to learn more about this important subject will benefit from the book.From the Contents:Liquid SurfacesThermodynamics of interfacesThe electric double layerEffects at charged interfacesSurface forcesContact angle phenomena and wettingSolid surfacesAdsorptionSurface modificationFriction, lubrication, and wearSurfactants, micelles, emulsions, and foamsThin films on surfaces of liquids",
