            "abstract": "\"Polymeric foams or cellular or expanded polymers have characteristics that makes their usage possible in several industrial and household purposes. This book is focused on the recent advancements in the synthesis of polymer foams, various foaming methods, foaming technology, mechanical and physical properties, and its wide variety of its applications. Divided into fourteen chapters, it explains empirical models connecting geometrical structure of foams with their properties including structure property relations. Features: Provides description of functional foams, their manufacturing methods, properties, and applications. Covers various blowing agents, greener methods for foaming and its emerging applicability. Illustrates comparative information regarding polymeric foams and its recent developments with polymer nanocomposite foams. Includes applications in mechanical, civil, biomedical, food packaging, electronics, health care industry, acoustics fields. Reviews elastomeric foams and their nanocomposite derivatives. This book aims at researchers, graduate students in materials science, mechanical engineering, and polymer science\"--",
