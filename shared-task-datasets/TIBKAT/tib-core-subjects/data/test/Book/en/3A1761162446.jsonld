                "Introduction: Time and the shared world -- The \"subject\" of inquiry -- Mineness and the practical first-person -- Being and otherness: Sartre's critique -- Heideggerian aprioricity and the categories of being -- The temporality of care -- F\u00fcrsorge: acknowledging the other Dasein -- Authenticity, inauthenticity, and the extremes of F\u00fcrsorge -- Conclusion",
                "Time and the Shared World challenges the common view that Heidegger offers few resources for understanding humanity\u2019s social nature. The book demonstrates that Heidegger\u2019s reformulation of traditional notions of subjectivity has wide-ranging implications for understanding the nature of human relationships. Contrary to entrenched critiques, Irene McMullin shows that Heidegger\u2019s characterization of selfhood as fundamentally social presupposes the responsive acknowledgment of each person\u2019s particularity and otherness. In doing so, McMullin argues that Heidegger\u2019s work on the social nature of the self must be located within a philosophical continuum that builds on Kant and Husserl\u2019s work regarding the nature of the a priori and the fundamental structures of human temporality, while also pointing forward to developments of these themes to be found in Heidegger\u2019s later work and in such thinkers as Sartre and Levinas. By developing unrecognized resources in Heidegger\u2019s work, Time and the Shared World is able to provide a Heidegger-inspired account of respect and the intersubjective origins of normativity."
