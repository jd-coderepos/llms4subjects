            "abstract": "\"Due to its abilities to compensate disturbances and uncertainties, disturbance observer based control (DOBC) is regarded as one of the most promising approaches for disturbance-attenuation. One of the first books on DOBC, Disturbance Observer Based Control: Methods and Applications presents novel theory results as well as best practices for applications in motion and process control that have already benefited numerous organizations.Supplying authoritative guidance in the areas of disturbance estimation and compensation for practical engineering systems, the book includes coverage of theoretic methods and practical applications of disturbance estimation and compensation for control systems through a DOBC approach. It considers applications in flight control systems, motion control systems, and process control systems.Supplies an authoritative overview of disturbance observer based control approachesReports on recent developments in disturbance estimation techniquesConsiders matched and mismatched disturbance/uncertainty attenuation for DOBCIllustrates applications of the methods covered with detailed engineering case studiesFilled with valuable insights gathered over decades of research by the authors, this book provides time- and stress-saving guidance for anyone interested in the theory and method research of DOBC. Using typical engineering examples, the text provides readers with an understanding of recent developments in DOBC as well as the tools required to make the most of this promising approach to disturbance-attenuation. \"--",
