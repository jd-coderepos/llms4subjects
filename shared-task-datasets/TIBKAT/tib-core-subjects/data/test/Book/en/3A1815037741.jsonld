            "abstract": "\"Bioremediation using microbes is a sustainable technology for biodegradation of target compounds and OMICS approach gives more clarity on these microbial communities. This book provides insights into the complex behavior of microbial communities and identifies enzymes/metabolites and their degradation pathways. It describes the application of microbes and their derivatives for bioremediation of potentially toxic and novel compounds. It highlights existing technologies along with industrial practices and real-life case studies. Features: Includes recent research and development in the areas of OMICS and microbial bioremediation. Covers the broad environmental pollution control approach such as metagenomics, metabolomics, fluxomics, bioremediation, and biodegradation of industrial wastes. Reviews metagenomics and waste management, and recycling for environmental cleanup. Describes the metagenomic methodologies and best practices, from sample collection to data analysis for taxonomies. Explores various microbial degradation pathways and detoxification mechanisms for organic and inorganic contaminants of wastewater with their gene expression. This book aims at Graduate students and researchers in environmental engineering, soil remediation, hazardous waste management, environmental modeling, and wastewater treatment\"--",
