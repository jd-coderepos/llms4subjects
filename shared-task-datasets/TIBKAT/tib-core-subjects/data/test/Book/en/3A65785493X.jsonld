                "\"Preface The discipline of Integrated Circuit Manufacturing (ICM) and the field of Design-for-Manufacturability DfM related to it, are extremely dynamic fields in technical concepts and market applications. This dynamism makes writing subject matter publications both easy and difficult. It is easy enough to provide an up-to date snapshot of ICM DfM issues, given the breadth of disciplines and the influx of publications. But is it harder to ensure any longevity of the existing technical solutions. Technical knowledge is often dated when already in the press. Therefore, the concept of this book is to focus on trends and correlations with which to define ICM DfM. DfM approaches proposed in other engineering fields and proven wrong 100 years, 50 years, or 1 year ago, have a high probability of being wrong in the future. A classic example is downplaying reliability to the short-term advantage of marketability. On the other hand, approaches successful in the past, such as correct-by-construction (CBC), are likely to positively impact product development also in the years to come\"--",
                "\"The direction of integrated circuit design (ICD) continues to gradually evolve. Focusing on economic rather than technical aspects, this book explains the concept of ICD for manufacturability and its major steps: product definition, design, layout, and manufacturing. Exploring the return-on-investment for ICD for manufacturing, the text presents realistic test cases of product challenges, examines possible solutions, and then demonstrates how to choose and implement the right strategy. The author carefully considers the technical and economical tradeoffs of ICD for manufacturing based on mature methodologies. He also addresses manufacturing techniques for physical, electrical, and logical design\"--"
