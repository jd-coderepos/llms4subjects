            "abstract": "\"In recent years, nanomaterials have become one of the most dynamic exploration fields in the areas of engineering, technology, and science. This new volume focuses on the use of various bionanomaterials that can be introduced into the body as clinical devices for various medical purposes. The book also provides examples of cost-effective, sustainable alternatives to traditional medical procedures. The volume discusses how these materials have diverse applications in the biomedical fields, such as for cancer treatment, for orthopedic joint replacements, for medical diagnosis, for making bone plates, for wound healing, for nerve regeneration, for breast implants, in dental procedures, and so on. In addition, the book also covers some nonbiomedical applications of nanobiomaterials, such as, for example, to grow cells in a culture medium, as a blood protein test in laboratories, etc. The enlightening selection of chapters in Sustainable Nanomaterials for Biomedical Engineering: Impacts, Challenges, and Future Prospects provides a rich multidisciplinary resource on biotechnological interventions using sustainable nanomaterials for academicians, environmentalists, practitioners, NGOs and industrialists who are working in the field of biosystems engineering, and others\"--",
