                "\"The highly-illustrated text will serve as excellent introduction for students, with and without a physics background, to superconductivity. With a strong practical, experimental emphasis, it will provide readers with an overview of the topic preparing them for more advanced texts used in more advanced undergraduate and post-graduate courses.The book will feature a series of practical, investigative, activities which can be used as tutor demonstrations or, more usefully, as student lab' exercises. All of the activities have been designed and tested by the author and colleagues and are designed to be as low cost as possible in order to promote whole class use.Contents: 1.
