            "abstract": "\"Large-scale adverse health and developmental outcomes related to tobacco affect millions of people across the world, raising serious questions from a human rights perspective. In response to this crisis, this timely book provides a comprehensive analysis of the promotion and enforcement of human rights protection in tobacco control law and policy at international, regional, and domestic levels. This thought-provoking book offers significant new insights to the topic, laying the foundations for a human rights based approach to tobacco control. Addressing the function of law as a tool to help combat one of the major public health challenges facing society, contributions by global scholars rebut human rights claims presented by the tobacco industry. Emphasis is instead placed upon the human rights of vulnerable individuals, children in particular, as a result of smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke. Illustrating ways in which the right to health can be advanced with regards to tobacco control, smoking and the use of e-cigarettes, this important book will be a vital resource for human rights and health law scholars and practitioners as well as policy makers in public health law\"--",
