                "An in-depth study of one of Boston's treasured cultural landmarks, the pioneering patron behind the collection, and the Pritzker Prize-winning architect who modernized the Gardner Museum's vision. When Isabella Stewart Gardner opened her exquisitely curated collection to the public in 1903, she could hardly have imagined the more than 250,000 visitors that now annually explore the art and furnishings housed in her historic re-creation of a Venetian palace. Tasked with the first addition to the museum since its founding, Renzo Piano Building Workshop has brought Gardner's vision into the new millennium. In addition to sumptuous images of the courtyards, gardens, and galleries of the original stone palazzo and rarely seen journal pages and photographs, this beautifully designed volume features architectural renderings and new photographs of the 70,000-square-foot wing. Essays address Gardner's life, including her friendships with Henry James, James McNeill Whistler, and John Singer Sargent; the museum's interaction with Renzo Piano Building Workshop; and the new building within the firm's distinguished museum work as a whole--",
