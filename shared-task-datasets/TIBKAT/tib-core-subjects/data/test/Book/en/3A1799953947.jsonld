            "abstract": "The story of microscopy over the years is one of wonder, revelation, and even love. What better words could there be to describe the amazing things that we have been able to see, learn and accomplish thanks to the progress made in this field? A love story between a pieace of glass and the rainbow with an original soundtrack mad of poetry and music. From Galilei\u2019s initial foray into basic optical microscopy, including the Camillo Golgi and Giuliano Toraldo di Francia lessons, to such later developments as time-resolved microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and three-dimensional microscopy to innovations such as optical nanoscopy, bioimaging and super resolution imaging, the book seeks to take the reader, be they scientist or layperson, on a journey through the evolution of the microscope and its many uses, including in the field of medicine. The author uses visible light as a through-line to unite the various chapters, as well as using fluorescence as a touchpoint from which to map the changes in the science, a significant choice, as it, along with label-free approaches and the addition of artificial intelligence, form the natural environment for development of the modern multi-messenger microscope towards bioimaging at the nanoscale.",
