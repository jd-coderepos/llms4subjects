                "M. Verstraete (1) and M. Menenti (2, 3) (1) Space Applications Institute, Ispra, Italy, (2) The Winand Staring Centre for Integrated Land, Soil and Water Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands and (3) Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur, Illkirch, France. The European Network for the development of Advanced Models to interpret Optical Remote Sensing data over terrestrial environments (ENAMORS) is a consortium of academic and research institutions involved in methodological research and in applications of remote sensing techniques for Earth Observation. It was supported initially through a Concerted Action from the Environment and Climate Research and Technology Development Program in the 4th Framework Program of the European Commission. Its activities include the organization of international scientific conferences, the first of which took place in Tuusula, Finland, from September 17 to 19, 1997. This book contains the proceedings of that conference and effectively summarizes the discussions and conclusions reached by the participants. The title of this meeting was \u2018Optical Remote Sensing of Terrestrial Surfaces: New Sensors, Advanced Algorithms, and the Opportunity for Novel Applications\u2019. It aimed at assembling representatives from the policy maker, remote sensing research and end-user communities, as well as from national and international space agencies and aerospace industries. Together, they discussed the need for R&D support, as well as the contents and priorities of such a program in this economic sector during the period covered by the 5th Framework Program (1999--2002).",
