            "abstract": "\"Take advantage of your ArcMap experience to get started now with ArcGIS Pro 2.9. With the retirement of ArcMap coming soon, users need a tool to learn ArcGIS Pro quickly and efficiently-one that explains the new approach and improved functionality without bogging down. Experienced users don't need an in-depth introduction but one that gets them up and running using ArcGIS Pro in their daily workflows. Switching to ArcGIS Pro from ArcMap, second edition, is the concise yet comprehensive source for bringing existing ArcMap users up to speed with ArcGIS Pro. Updated and tested against ArcGIS Pro 2.9, this book introduces experienced ArcMap users to the ribbons, panes, and project-based structure of ArcGIS Pro. Covering the most common and important workflows required for most GIS work, this book concentrates on a project for Crater Lake in Oregon, so users will quickly become familiar with the data and be able to focus on learning the ArcGIS Pro UI in 10 chapters. Written by an author with 20-plus years of experience writing textbooks using Esri software, Switching to ArcGIS Pro from ArcMap, second edition, takes any frustration out of making the switch to the premier professional desktop GIS application from Esri\"--",
