            "abstract": "A comprehensive book on Selldorf Architects, with a detailed look at the museums, residences, and public buildings the firm has designed in the United States and abroad. Founding principal Annabelle Selldorf was born in Cologne, Germany and educated at the Pratt Institute and Syracuse University. The firm launched into international prominence with the opening of New York's Neue Galerie in 2001. Since, Selldorf Architects has become known for galleries, cultural projects, and private homes. More recently, the firm has made its mark with Sims Municipal Recycling in Brooklyn in 2013. The design and construction won an award for Excellence in Design from the Public Design Commission. In 2014, Selldorf Architects received the commission to build the expansion of the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego. This book begins with an extensive conversation between Tom Eccles and Annabelle Selldorf, as well as an essay by architecture critic Ian Volner. A newly-shot, full color portfolio by renowned photographer Todd Eberle is complimented by an in-depth look at the story behind 30 selected projects, including architectural plans and sketches",
