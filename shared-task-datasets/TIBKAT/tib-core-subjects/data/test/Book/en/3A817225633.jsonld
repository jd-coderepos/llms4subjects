            "abstract": "\"Globalization and the rapid increase in world trade in the past decade have contributed to greater demand for international transport and logistics and, consequently, the expansion of the maritime industry. The dramatic changes in the mode of world trade and cargo transportation make it more important than ever to have a clear understanding of the way in which freight is transported by sea and the role of ports in this exchange. Maritime Logistics examines the latest development, knowledge, and practices taking place in logistics and supply chains within the port and shipping industry. In this revised edition there are new chapters on port-centric logistics in concept and practice, hinterland logistics and global supply chains, maritime transport and logistics as a trade facilitator, and future trends and developments. All the topics have been significantly overhauled in order to avoid repetition and to reflect advancements in maritime logistics. There are also a number of new international contributors. Written by a team of experts, who provide a truly global perspective on this increasingly key area of logistics, the book covers everything that students of logistics, as well as those working within the industry should know and understand, including shipping lines, dry bulk, and port-centric logistics. \"--",
