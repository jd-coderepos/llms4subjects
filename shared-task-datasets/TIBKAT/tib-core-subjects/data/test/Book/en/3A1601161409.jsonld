            "abstract": "About this book: Presents both traditional and recent advances in remediation,  Complicated techniques are easily explained, Treatment facilities and processes are depicted using over 150 diagrams and photographs. This book provides a comprehensive overview of remediation and rehabilitation techniques and strategies for contaminated and anthropogenically disturbed land.  Rehabilitation approaches in the urban environment, such as brownfield redevelopment and urban mining, are discussed.   In relation to contaminated land, techniques for soil containment and decontamination of soil, soil vapour and groundwater are comprehensively and systematically presented. Complicated treatment techniques are schematically depicted and can be readily understood.  The more traditional approaches, such as soil washing, bioremediation, and pump-and-treat, are introduced, but the younger fields of remediation, like phytoremediation, funnel-and-gate, and steam-enhanced extraction, are also taken into consideration.  Agricultural, silvicultural and environmentally sustainable rehabilitation strategies for reclaiming disturbed land/terrain in former mining or natural-resource extraction areas, such as open-cast mines, quarries, harvested peatlands, open-pit mines and subsided mining terrain (sinkholes), are introduced.  Since this book gives a complete and systematic overview of all types of soil, soil vapour and groundwater remediation techniques, as well as rehabilitation approaches for soils/terrain in mining areas, it will be a useful tool not only for universities and research institutes, but also for private consultants and public authorities engaged in the treatment of contaminated or disturbed land.
