            "abstract": [
                "\"Microalgae architecture has gained awareness for its biotechnical potential to achieve net-zero energy architecture while also promoting ecological sustainability and occupant well-being. Microalgae Building Enclosures: Design and Engineering Principles aims to provide design, engineering, and biotechnical guidelines for microalgae building enclosures that need to be considered for symbiotic relations among the built environment, humans, and ecosystems. Part I of the book introduces the theoretical background of microalgae as a bioremediator and future energy system and their potential roles toward sustainable and healthy built environments. Part II exemplifies interventions and multiple benefits of microalgae systems in product, architecture, urban, and infrastructure applications across the globe including the US, the UK, Germany, Spain, Korea and Iran. Part III explains the design and engineering criteria, biotechnical design requirements, and various performance metrics for microalgae architecture. Finally, Part IV investigates potential building applications in low-rise buildings, high-rise buildings, and energy efficient retrofitting. The book also includes international case studies of microalgae fa\u00e7ade typologies within various building types and climates. As one of the first books to comprehensively cover this emerging area of microalgae building enclosures, Microalgae Building Enclosures is an essential source for professionals and students looking to expand architectural discourse on nature integrated building systems to achieve the triple bottom line of sustainability\"--",
