                "Materials for Biomedical Engineering: Biopolymer Fibers discusses the use of biopolymer fibers in the development of biomedical applications. It provides a recent review of the main types of polymeric fibers and their impact in biomedicine and related fields. The development of different instruments, such as sensors, medical fibers, and textiles are discussed, along with how they greatly benefited by progress made in polymeric fibers. The book provides a comprehensive and updated reference on the latest research in the field of biopolymers and their composites in relation to medical applications.--",
