            "abstract": "The book is a primer of the theory of ordinary differential equations. The presentation is simple, yet thorough and rigorous. Each chapter ends with a broad set of exercises that range from routine to the more challenging and thought provoking. Solutions to selected exercises can be found at the end of the book. The book contains many interesting examples on topics such as electric circuits, the pendulum equation, the logistic equation, the Lotka-Volterra system, the Laplace transform, etc, which introduce students to some interesting aspects of the theory and applications. The work is mainly intended for students of mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, computer sciences and other areas of the sciences and social sciences that use ordinary differential equations, with knowledge of calculus and a minimal understanding of the basic concepts in linear algebra. Included are also a few more advanced topics, such as stability theory and boundary value problems, which may be suitable for more advanced undergraduate or first year graduate students. --",
