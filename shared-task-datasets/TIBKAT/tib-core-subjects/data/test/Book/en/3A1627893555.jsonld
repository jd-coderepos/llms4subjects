Showing readers everything they need to know about rare books and special collections, this wide-ranging book offers coverage of such key topics as: the profession s history and its relevance in the face of an increasingly digital world; archives relationship to the special collections department and their role in the wider institution; collection development, cataloging, processing, physical layout, and other operational functions, with coverage of acquisition sources and methods; what everyone needs to know about the physical materials in their care, including preservation, conservation, and restoration, storage, handling, and security; reference and outreach services, including a look at exhibitions and tours; fundraising and financial management; legal and ethical issues; forgeries, fakes, and facsimiles; bibliography and its impact on the rare book world, including a look at booksellers, donors, and auctions; the present state of books in our digital environment; the vocabulary of the trade. Rare Books and Special Collections presents a meticulous and systematic understanding of this growing field",
