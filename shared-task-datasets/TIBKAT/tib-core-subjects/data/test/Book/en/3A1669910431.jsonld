            "abstract": "\"Whole life costing is now integral to building procurement both for new buildings and major refurbishments. It is key when assessing investment scenarios for estates as well as individual buildings, and has become a tool for justifying higher capital cost items. Standard whole life costing methods combine capital cost, facilities costs, operational costs, income, and disposal costs with a \"single action - single benefit\" approach . In contrast, the unique appraoch used by the authors of this book explains how to analyse the operational and facilities costs of a building, while also taking into account secondary and tertiary costs of a variety of actions, for example: - the secondary effect of low energy lighting to cooling and heating loads - the multiple benefits of increased insulation - the effect of building orientation to the operating costs of the building - how design decisions affect occupant comfort The reader will be shown how to incorporate this new method of whole life costing into standard cost models, increasing their accuracy. Written by a team of authors immersed in whole life costing throughout their professional lives, this is the most practical guide to the topic available\"--",
