Cushing, American Journal of Physics\"Physicists should make every effort to enjoy this well-conducted tour of the history of physics\" -John Barrow, New Scientist\" A brilliant presentation of the ideas of modern physics presented in a richly painted historical setting... This book contains more physics than most physicists know, and more intellectual history than most historians know, woven together in a thoughtful, erudite, and enthusiastic presentation that is unique in both popular and academic science writing... The rise of statistical physics, quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology are accompanied by trenchant examples that encapsulate the core of current controversy, and the older material is informed by recent sophistications of historical scholarship\"-Choice",
