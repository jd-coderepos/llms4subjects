Beginning with a look at the lighting design profession, Livingston describes the physics of light, human perception of light (including psychology), and goes on to describe lamps and fixtures in use today, as well as those on the horizon. Communication of design ideas and the design process is emphasized, urging the reader to think about how the design will make a space should look and feel. The practicalities of documenting the design, and consideration of architectural details, lighting controls, photometrics and calculations are explained in a clear manner, with ancillary exercises and pedagogy to help give the reader a working knowledge.  Finally, issues of sustainability  (including daylighting), lighting and health, and building and energy codes are each addressed in their own chapters.This complete guide is attractively illustrated throughout in color and sure to be the reference resource of choice for anyone performing lighting design\"--"
