                "By far the most commonly encountered and energy-intensive unit operation in almost all industrial sectors, industrial drying continues to attract the interest of scientists, researchers, and engineers. The Handbook of Industrial Drying, Fourth Edition not only delivers a comprehensive treatment of the current state of the art, but also serves as a consultative reference for streamlining industrial drying operations."
