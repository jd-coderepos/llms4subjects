            "abstract": "\"Preface When a project authority writes a request for a proposal to scope out systems design activities for achieving envisioned system goals, what systems design approaches should be requested in the statement of work? When systems designers respond to this request, what analytical techniques and design methodologies should they propose to identify the detailed design requirements and associated constraints that will allow them to further the design? When the required information is available for the design, what implementation and evaluation methods should design engineers follow? These are common, critical questions that many project authorities, systems designers, and design engineers must address in their day-to-day jobs. Answering these questions is not easy, as many different systems design theories, analytical techniques, and design methods are available in various application domains. It is especially difficult when considering the advance of modern technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, cloud-based computing, and social media technologies. As more and more intelligent and adaptive systems surround us in our daily lives, it is increasingly important that systems designers incorporate knowledge of human capabilities and limitations into new designs. For example, in today's digital age, the amount of accessible information continues to increase dramatically. Intelligent adaptive systems (IASs) offer opportunities to tailor and manage the deluge of information in an interaction-centered way. Responsive and context-sensitive design is the most promising solution to the overwhelming amounts of data we face in our daily working and personal lives\"--",
