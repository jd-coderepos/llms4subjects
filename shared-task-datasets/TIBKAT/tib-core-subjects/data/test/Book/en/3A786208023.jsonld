            "abstract": "The central Mosque of the Turkish-Islamic Union in K\u00f6ln-Ehrenfeld has given us one of the most vigorously discussed German building projects of the past 10 years. With this spectacular domed structure, Paul B\u00f6hm, the youngest son of Pritzker Prize-winner Gottfried B\u00f6hm and grandchild of Dominikus B\u00f6hm, has successfully introduced the Osman mosque typus into the modern age. The dome and minaret provide the Turkish/Islamic community with visual identification points. At the same time, this shell-construction structure is broken up into individual segments in a manner that opens it up to both the neighbourhood and the world. Containing conference halls, rooms for community use, a bazaar, a library and a museum, the complex is intended to convey to the surrounding area a message of retained ties to the historical country of origin coupled with acceptance and integration into the new homeland, and a willingness to engage in dialogue. Up to now the mosque represents the highpoint of the architectural career of Paul B\u00f6hm, who was born in 1959 and who is teaching at the Fachhochschule K\u00f6ln. His work encompasses a multitude of exciting projects and realised buildings, including cultural buildings, university buildings, administration buildings and residential buildings. It is, perhaps, unsurprising that an architect who comes from a family of church builders should have added an impressive religious structure to \u0153uvre. St. Theodor in K\u00f6ln-Vingst is a central-plan building that possesses a coherent atmosphere suited to contemplation whilst, at the same time, opening itself to a part of the city that suffers from social problems",
