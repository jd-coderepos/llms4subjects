                "This volume provides conceptual strategies and methodological know-how over a wide range of stress situations that can be used as stepping stones to unravel the intricacies of abiotic stress signaling networks in plants. Chapters guide readers through achievements and challenges in the field and through up-to-date protocols covering identification of novel processes, validation of hypothetical mechanisms, and further characterization of currently-known pathways. Written in the format of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series, wet-lab chapters include an introduction to the topic, lists necessary materials and methods, includes tips on troubleshooting and known pitfalls, and step-by-step, readily reproducible protocols. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Plant Abiotic Stress Signaling aims to be a comprehensive and innovative guide for students and researchers seeking to understand plant molecular mechanisms at the interface with environmental constraints and climate change.",
