                "This book summarizes recent advances in the processing of waste biomass resources to produce biofuels and biochemicals. Worldwide interest in clean energy sources, environmental protection, and mitigating global warming is rapidly gaining momentum and spurring on the search for alternative energy sources, especially for the transportation and industrial sectors. This book reviews the opportunities presented by low-cost organic waste materials, discussing their suitability for alternative fuel and fine chemical production, physicochemical characterization, conversion technologies, feedstock and fuel chemistry, refining technologies, fuel upgrading, residue management, and the circular economy. In addition, it explores applied aspects of biomass conversion by highlighting several significant thermochemical, hydrothermal and biological technologies. In summary, the book offers comprehensive and representative descriptions of key fuel processing technologies, energy conversion and management, waste valorization, eco-friendly waste remediation, biomass supply chain, lifecycle assessment, techno-economic analysis and the circular bioeconomy."
