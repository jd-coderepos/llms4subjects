The built environment in which architectural finishes are found is one that is constantly changing. Styles go out of fashion, use changes, and new finishes are applied. Previous finishes are often hidden below later layers - the macroscopic and microscopic study of which are important for the documentation, conservation and restoration of these materials, the finishes and the architecture. Architectural Paint Research aims to further our knowledge of materials and techniques not only of paints and varnishes but also gilding, decorative plasterwork and stucco, wood finishes and wallpapers",
