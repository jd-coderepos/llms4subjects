                "Within the scope of this work the plasmapolymerisation of aminogroup containing and perfluorinated hydrocarbons with a microplasma jet at atmospheric pressure was investigated. The goal was a first time successful deposition of amino-functional and Teflon-like coatings. To achieve this, a experimental setup for the deposition process was planned and realised. It consists of the plasma jet, and the surrounding glass vessel, which allows the generation of different ambient atmospheres at normal pressure and also protects the experimenter from potentially produced toxic components. As the first task, the deposition with the aminogroup containing precursors Cyclopropylamine (CPA) und Ethylendiamine (EDA) was pursued. It turned out that a deposition in self-organized jet mode was possible. The coatings possess a dome-shaped deposition profile a homogeneous chemical structure with a nitrogen content of up to 20 %. Depending on the treatment time and used ambient atmosphere, [NH2]/[C] values between 5.5 % and 3 % (EDA) as well as 4 % and 1 % (CPA) were obtained. The protective gas atmosphere, consisting of nitrogen and hydrogen, which was meant to support the formation of primary aminogroups, was impacting the process negatively. Compared to processes with air as ambient atmposphere the deposition rate was halved. Furthermore, a positive effect on the amount of primary aminogroups was only observed with CPA ..."
