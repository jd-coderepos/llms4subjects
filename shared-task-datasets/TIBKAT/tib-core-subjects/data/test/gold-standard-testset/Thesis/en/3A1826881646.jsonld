            "abstract": "Recent developments in microscopic imaging led to a better understanding of intra- and intercellular metabolic processes and, for example, to visualize structural properties of viral pathogens. In this thesis, the imaging process of widefield and confocal scanning microscopy techniques is treated holistically to highlight general strategies and maximise their information content. Poisson or shot noise is assumed to be the fundamental noise process for the given measurements. A stable focus position is a basic condition for e.g. long-term measurements in order to provide reliable information about potential changes inside the Field-of-view. While newer microscopy systems can be equipped with hardware autofocus, this is not yet the widespread standard. For image-based focus analysis, different metrics for ideal, noisy and aberrated, in case of spherical aberration and astigmatism, measurements are presented. A stable focus position is also relevant in the example of 2-photon confocal imaging and at the same time the situation is aggravated in the given example, the measurement of the retina in the living mouse. In addition to the natural drift of the focal position, which can be evaluated by means of previously introduced metrics, rhythmic heartbeat, respiration, unrhythmic muscle twitching and movement of the mouse kept in artificial sleep are added. A dejittering algorithm is presented for the measurement data obtained under these circumstances. Using the additional information about the sample distribution in ISM, a method for reconstructing 3D from 2D image data is presented in the form of thick slice unmixing. This method can further be used for suppression of light generated outside the focal layer of 3D data stacks and is compared to selective layer multi-view deconvolution. To reduce phototoxicity and save valuable measurement time for a 3D stack, the method of zLEAP is presented, by which omitted Z-planes are subsequently calculated and inserted.",
