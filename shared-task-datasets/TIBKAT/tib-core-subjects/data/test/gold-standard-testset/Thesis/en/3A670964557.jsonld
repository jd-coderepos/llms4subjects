                "Transition metal complexes play a crucial role in antitumor therapy. Complexes of platinum, ruthenium as well as lanthanum and gallium have been investigated in preclinical as well as in clinical studies. The best known platinum(II) agents approved worldwide, cisplatin or carboplatin, are used in nearly 50% of all cancer therapies. This work focused on the development of new metal-based drugs that could act against human cancer cells. It was motivated in part by previous work with Cu(II) complexes, reporting new coordination compounds of SOD mimicking and cytotoxic activities. On the basis of this work we chose several commercially available heterocyclic ligands to synthesize new metal ion complexes in search of their interesting biological activity. New as well as previously reported Cu(II), Co(II), Pt(II) and Zn(II) complexes were synthesized using various ligands (1-6). Almost all chelating 2:1 ligand-metal complexes were obtained generally in water at room temperature in the reaction of metal(II) chloride with corresponding aromatic nitrogen ligands bearing an O-carboxylate group ligand. The synthesized chelating complexes were characterized by the use of spectroscopic methods, elemental analyses and HPLC chromatography and some by X-ray crystallography. Such coordination compounds are easily formed by transition metals with free orbitals d that can accept the donor electron pairs. The coordination is through the heterocyclic nitrogen and carboxylate ...",
