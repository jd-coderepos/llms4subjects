            "abstract": "The work presented here aims for the artificial variation of magnetic nanoparticle surfaces using different macromolecular building blocks and grafting methods which incorporated straightforward grafting approaches of various commonly used polymers and furthermore the introduction of novel functional (weak) polyzwitterions as surface ligands. The latter polymers gave access to multifunctional nanocarriers that react both to external magnetic fields and the surrounding pH value. The majority of the polyzwitterions currently investigated consists of functional groups that enable permanent zwitterionic state over a very wide pH range. The novelty of the polymers presented in this work lies in the pHdependent charge through the use of weak acid and base groups. These weak polyzwitterions expand the latest scope of polymer coatings for magnetic nanoparticles and enable ways of charge-based transport or catch and release at the nanoscale. The synergistic effects by combination of magnetic core and pH responsive shell enable possible applications in various fields, ranging from recyclable wastewater treatment agents to tailored drug delivery nanocarriers, as outlined in this work. The investigation of interfacial electrostatic interactions with charged guests was of great interest according to the application areas. A fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms could be obtained by varying both the surrounding pH, guest molecules and polyzwitterion on the surface of the MCNPs. Three different coatings based on polyampholytes enabled hereby changes in the electrostatic interactions and gave insights into the underlying and as yet hardly investigated dependency of functional groups and electrostatic interactions on surfaces. The electrostatic interactions have furthermore been studied intensively to provide a straightforward approach to the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles with versatile new properties such as fluorescence and plasmonic resonance based on interface adsorption, which allowed the merging of different properties by a noncovalent combination of individual building blocks resulting in new types of nanocomposites.",
