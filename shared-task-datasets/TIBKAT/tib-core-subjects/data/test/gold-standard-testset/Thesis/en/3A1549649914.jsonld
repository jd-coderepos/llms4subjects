            "title": "Measuring the Higgs self-coupling at the International Linear Collider",
            "abstract": "In this thesis, the experimental prospects of measuring the Standard Model (SM) Higgs self-coupling \u03bbS M at the International Linear Collider (ILC) are investigated. The observation of double Higgs production is necessary to directly establish a non-zero Higgs self-coupling. Information on \u03bbS M can be extracted from a measurement of the cross section for this process. At a centre-of-mass energy of \u221as = 500 GeV double Higgs- strahlung is the dominant Higgs-pair production process. This measurement is extremely challenging due to very small production cross sections and multi-jet final states which pose large challenges to detector technologies and event reconstruction techniques. A detailed full detector simulation of the International Large Detector is performed for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. The analysis is based on ILC beam parameters ac- cording to the Technical Design Report and investigates several improvements compared to earlier studies. These include an isolated lepton selection strategy and the application of kinematic fits to final states with heavy-flavoured jets. Depending on the decay mode of the Z boson, relative improvements of up to 25% are obtained in the selection of ZHH (HH \u2192 bbbb) events. This results in a relative improvement of 10% in the measure- ment of \u03c3ZHH when combining all channels. For the SM scenario, an evidence of 3.5\u03c3 for the observation of double Higgs-strahlung and a measurement precision of 30% on \u03c3ZHH is reached with an integrated luminosity of L = 2 ab\u22121 and a beam polarisation of P(e+e\u2212) = (0.3,\u22120.8). The result extrapolates to an achievable precision of 21% on \u03c3ZHH after the full ILC running scenario, which corresponds to a 5.9\u03c3 discovery for the observation of double Higgs-stahlung. Combined with the channel HH \u2192 bbWW, \u03c3ZHH can even be measured to a precision of 16%, which corresponds to a precision of 26% on \u03bbS M. Additionally, the impact of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 low-pT hadrons background is investigated, which proves the need of advanced removal strategies, which include a detailed modelling of the background and exploit the full power of high-granularity detectors.",
