            "abstract": "In poultry farming, the prevalence of foot pad dermatitis is an important indicator for animal welfare. Foot pad dermatitis is mainly caused by wet litter. Litter moisture is influenced, among others, by diet, bedding material and housing climate. One approach to reduce litter moisture is the to apply charcoal as feed additive. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effects of herbal fermentation extract enriched charcoal as 0.2 % feed additive on the growth performance and selected health parameters of broiler chickens and fattening turkey toms under on-farm conditions. The charcoal was supposed to absorb liquids in the faeces, which could decrease the litter moisture and in consequence, this could improve foot pad health. The diet of the turkey was additionally protein-reduced for the first half of the fattening period to reduce nitrogen emission. Representative samples of animals were individually weighed and scored regularly. The focus was placed on foot pad dermatitis. Furthermore, hock burns, soiled feathering and soiled cloacae were scored in chickens, and breast buttons and soiled cloacae were graded in turkeys. The dry matter content of litter samples was analysed, and in turkey litter, the total nitrogen was evaluated. Neither in broiler chickens nor in turkeys did the dietary charcoal affect the growth performance. Although the dry matter content of the litter was increased in all treatment groups, pododermatitis was significantly reduced in broiler chickens but not in turkeys. The other parameters were not affected. It can be concluded that the supplementation of 0.2 % enriched charcoal cannot improve the growth performance of broiler chickens and male fattening turkeys. Whereas charcoal reduced the severity of foot pad dermatitis in broiler chickens effectively, it was not an efficient feed additive in turkeys. The protein reduction did not influence the slaughter weight, though this might be a promising approach for reducing nitrogen emission.",
