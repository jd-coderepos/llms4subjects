                "This book introduces modern safety management in rail transport, focusing on the challenges resulting from the digital economy. It details how the cybersecurity of railway technical systems and risk can be managed. The rail transport sector is increased integrated into the digital economy. Ensuing the safety of technical systems and managing the rail system as a whole are key challenges for rail transport designers, managers, users and other stakeholders. Developing of rail transport based on the interoperability of different systems requires both searching for modern solutions and ensuring a high level of standardization of processes. In the context of the widespread digitalization of railway systems, new hazards arise that can lead to undesirable events. This book examines these issues. The book will be of interest to rail professionals, and researchers into transport systems and reliability.",
