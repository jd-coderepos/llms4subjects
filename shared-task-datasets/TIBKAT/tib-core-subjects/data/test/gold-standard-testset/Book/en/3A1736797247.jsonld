                "\"Despite a long tradition of sophisticated, creative materials synthesis among quantum materials researchers, a sense of broader community has been lacking. In initiating the Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School held annually at the University of Maryland, we wanted to bring together the next generation of growers to learn techniques and pointers directly from senior scientists, and it turns out that we were not alone. The enthusiasm from both students and teachers has been both gratifying and invigorating. Four schools later, we can confidently say that physicists, chemists, and materials scientists, experimentalists and theorists alike, all want to know how to make a good sample. With this in mind, we asked our lecturers to record their most important ideas and share their expertise with a broader audience. This resource is a compilation of fundamental and practical guides on the modern methods of materials synthesis utilized by these experts. We hope that you enjoy reading their essential guidance and state-of-the-art techniques as you explore the Fundamentals of Quantum Materials\"--"
