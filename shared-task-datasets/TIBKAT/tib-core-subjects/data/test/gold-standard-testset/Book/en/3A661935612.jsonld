Rather than merely digesting the abstract generalized concepts and mathematical relations governing thermodynamics, this book allows engineers to develop an approach that will allow them to tackle new problems.Employing almost 300 illustrations and 150 examples to enhance clarity, unlike more conventional texts, the book presents the phenomenological approach to a problem and then delves into the details. Using a self-teaching format, the authors keep esoteric material to a minimum while favoring concrete examples and applications. The book includes several tables containing thermodynamic properties and other useful information. Additional material is available for download\"--",
