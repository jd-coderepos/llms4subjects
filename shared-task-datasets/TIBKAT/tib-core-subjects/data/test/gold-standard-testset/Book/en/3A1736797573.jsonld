                "\"Sustainable use and management of water resources, considering energy and food dimensions, in the context of climate change is a challenging endeavour worldwide. Achieving many of the environmental sustainable development goals (SDGs) depends on the efficient use of the water resources. It's therefore imperative to rely on the best modern scientific and practical achievements in the field of hydrogeosciences and associated approaches and methods. Water, Climate Change, and Sustainability provides key concepts in hydrogeosciences, introduces relevant field and modelling techniques to demonstrate their applications in water-sector with specific case studies, and discerns future directions of research and practical application related to the expected patterns of climate changes in different regions of the world. Volume highlights include: - Key concepts of practical applications of theory and methods of hydrogeosciences for sustainable development of water resources - Diverse approaches and methods for analyzing water resources and associated risks, pollution levels, vulnerability, and security - Practical applications of water resources in procuring food security, good health, clean energy and climate action Water, Climate Change, and Sustainability is a valuable resource for professionals, researchers, and graduate students from a wide variety of fields including hydrogeology, climate change, geophysics, geochemistry, geography, geohealth, and environmental science\"--"
