                "This book provides the reader with the most up-to-date knowledge of blockchain in mainstream areas of security, trust, and privacy in the decentralized domain, which is timely and essential (this is due to the fact that the distributed and P2P applications is increasing day-by-day, and the attackers adopt new mechanisms to threaten the security and privacy of the users in those environments). This book also provides the technical information regarding blockchain-oriented software, applications, and tools required for the researcher and developer experts in both computing and software engineering to provide solutions and automated systems against current security, trust and privacy issues in the cyberspace. Cybersecurity, trust and privacy (CTP) are pressing needs for governments, businesses, and individuals, receiving the utmost priority for enforcement and improvement in almost any societies around the globe. Rapid advances, on the other hand, are being made in emerging blockchain technology with broadly diverse applications that promise to better meet business and individual needs. Blockchain as a promising infrastructural technology seems to have the potential to be leveraged in different aspects of cybersecurity promoting decentralized cyberinfrastructure. Blockchain characteristics such as decentralization, verifiability and immutability may revolve current cybersecurity mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity, reliability, and integrity of data. Almost any article on the blockchain points out that the cybersecurity (and its derivatives) could be revitalized if it is supported by blockchain technology. Yet, little is known about factors related to decisions to adopt this technology, and how it can systemically be put into use to remedy current CTP\u2019s issues in the digital world. This book provides information for security and privacy experts in all the areas of blockchain, cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, forensics, smart contracts, computer systems, computer networks, software engineering, applied artificial intelligence for computer security experts, big data analysts, and decentralized systems. Researchers, scientists and advanced level students working in computer systems, computer networks, artificial intelligence, big data will find this book useful as well.",
