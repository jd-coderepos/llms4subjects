            "abstract": "\"This textbook will provide an introduction to the fundamental and applied aspects of biophysics for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of physics, chemistry, and biology. The application of physics principles and techniques in exploring biological systems has long been a tradition in scientific research. Biological systems hold naturally inbuilt physical principles and processes which are popularly explored. Systematic discoveries have been made helping to understand the structures and functions of individual biomolecules, biomolecular systems, cells, organelles, tissues, and even the whole physiological systems of the animal and plant kingdoms. The trend in utilizing the physics-based scientific understanding of biological systems in exploring disease states and finding relevant cures through discovering drugs is considered to be at the forefront of applied scientific and socioeconomic interests. This book will cover most of the relevant breakthroughs biophysics has been making since its inception. A futuristic guideline will be provided. A lot of models based on both classical and quantum mechanical treatments of biological systems and future scientific research outlooks will be presented. Diseases related to physical alterations in biomolecular structures and organizations and concerned drug discovery strategies will be scrutinized. Nanotechnology application in manipulating nanoprocesses in biological systems will be addressed\"--",
