                "\"The invitation to assemble this book was a surprise. Undoubtedly a primary source for the invitation was the conference to honor Chen Ning Yang whom I first met personally on 19 November 1963 when Freeman Dyson invited me to speak at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Before my talk Freeman took me for lunch with the Director, J. Robert Oppenheimer; also joining the lunch was C.N. Yang and his guest, T.T. Wu, whose work I also knew. In accepting the invitation to publish a collection of my review articles I was moved by the fact that I had always talked about my findings in a general way once I had been intrigued by a field. And, if I had actually contributed to an area of science, I was often moved to express what I had learned in its simplest terms and with lots of figures. Indeed, since my earliest days I had often framed my thoughts in terms of two or three-dimensional images. It was also encouraging that my propensity for writing reviews -- with crucial references carefully listed -- had been recognized formally, in 1983, by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences through their James Murray Luck Award for excellence in scientific reviewing\"--"
