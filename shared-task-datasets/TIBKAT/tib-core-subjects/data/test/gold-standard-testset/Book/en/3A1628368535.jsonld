            "abstract": "\"Preface The world is a changed place. The collaborative web has caught our collective imagination and there is no turning back, particularly in the business world. Some have taken to calling this use of collaborative technologies in business Enterprise 2 (E 2.0). Wikipedia may have been the first company to popularize the phenomenon of usergenerated knowledge, but this encyclopedia is just the tip of the iceberg. Companies far and wide are wiki-izing. Nokia hosts a number of wikis, some of which are used internally to coordinate technology research. Dresdner Kleinwort, an investment bank, operates the largest corporate wiki. About 50% of Dresdner staff use this wiki to make sure that all team members are on the same project management page. E 2.0 is more than just wikis, of course. It constitutes the entirety of social networking applications including blogs, discussion boards, workspaces, and anything else that is sharable, and even combinable (i.e., mashups). IBM uses E 2.0 for everything from collaborative document production to internal project collaboration. Nokia uses it for all-purpose teamware. A whole host of companies use it for knowledge management. Honeywell was one of the first to use E 2.0 to perform knowledge discovery, research, and sharing across miles--regardless of whether users even know each other. It would appear, then, that E 2.0 using social networking technologies has wide applicability to all things business--including software engineering. Software development projects are usually complex and often mission critical. Successful software development projects usually have something in common. Each of these projects, in some way, shape or form, follows one or more principles of applied software engineering methodology\"--",
