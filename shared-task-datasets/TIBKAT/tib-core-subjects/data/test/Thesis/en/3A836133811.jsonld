                "Because heavy metal ions prefer to bind sulfur, inspired by molybdopterin the main goal of this work was combining dithiolene binding moieties with optically active substituents with the aim to detect/capture metal ions, which could preferably bind to the dithiolene moiety of for instance MPT. Therefore a number of dithiolene based molecules mimicking the natural immediate coordination sphere composition of Mo and W dependent oxidoreductase enzymes were synthesized and characterized by NMR, MS, IR, X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis, EPR and electrochemical methods. In order to work at the lowest possible base concentration due to potentially base sensitive substituents and reaction partners, the procedure for the de-protection of the ligand precursors and the in situ complexation reaction was first optimized in course of the work and interim we explored the surprising fact that the ring opening reaction of the 1,3- dithiol-2-one system is fully reversible and can be controlled simply by adjusting the pH-value of the solution. Then, the coordination behavior of the de-protected ligands towards different metal ions, including biologically relevant ions like Cu+, Cu2+, Fe3+ was tested. As the optically active substituents necessarily possess interesting electronic properties, a second focus of this work was to utilize the developed ligand systems for MoCo and WCo models and to investigate their potential catalytic activity in the model oxotransfer reaction between DMSO and PPh3 in ...",
