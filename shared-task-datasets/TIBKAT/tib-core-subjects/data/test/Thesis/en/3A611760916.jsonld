            "abstract": "The present thesis concern is the initial value problem for three nonlinear systems of partial differential equations: the Vlasov-Darwin system, the Vlasov-Poisswell system and a version of the latter which is called the modified Vlasov-Poisswell system. These equations belong to kinetic theory, which has proved useful when describing large particle systems in different areas of physics such as kinetic theory of gases, the formation of stellar structures or plasma physics. In the present thesis equations originating in plasma physics are considered which describe the evolution of the time dependent density function f(t,x,v) (t - time, x  position, v - particle velocity) of a large ensemble of charged particles in the (x,v)-phase space influenced by the electromagnetic field created by the particles and when neglecting collisions. The focus of the investigation is on existence and uniqueness questions for solutions of the initial value problem, i.e., it is asked whether there exists a solution f of the system under consideration such that f(t=0)=f0 where f0 is a prescribed initial datum. In order to answer this question further properties of solutions such as energy and charge conservation or decay rates must be taken into account. An important issue is, whether - if necessary under additional hypotheses or by weakening the concept of solution - global solutions, i.e., solutions existing for all t>=0, may be obtained ...",
