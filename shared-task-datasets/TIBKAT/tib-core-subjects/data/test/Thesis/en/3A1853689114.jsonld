            "title": "Stress and its impact on the mental health of elite athletes - an analytical overview",
            "abstract": "In elite sports various stressors (non-sport-specific and sport-specific), such as the permanent pressure to achieve maximum performance, continuous high risk of injury, pressure from the coach, sponsors or organizers, expectations of the media or society exist. Very often these stressors are associated with negative consequences for physical and mental health (e.g., loss of self-control or identity crises). Staying healthy and maintaining (mental) health is given the highest priority in the athletic context. To date, however in elite sports publications regarding stress and its impact on mental health are still rare. This paper aims to analyse the impact of stress on mental health in the context of elite sports. The intention is furthermore to illustrate based on current literature coping strategies as resources to promote mental health of elite athletes. Additionally, risk factors pertaining to mental disorders will be analysed, as they potentially entail impairments of mental health in the target group. This information should facilitate to gain further insight in mechanisms and relationships of variables, which may on the one hand provoke mental health impairments in elite athletes and otherwise protect their mental health. Against this background the following central research questions arise: \u2022 Which impact does stress have on the mental health of elite athletes? \u2022 Which strategies could be employed to promote mental health in elite sports? To answer these questions and to describe stress and mental health in the context of elite sports various terms such as \"stress\", \"stressor\", \"mental health\", \"coping\" and \"risk factor\" will be explained. Three systematic reviews will form the \"core\" of the paper. In a conclusion part implications for future research designs referring to the above-mentioned questions and considering current study findings will be discussed.",
