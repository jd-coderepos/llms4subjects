            "abstract": "Summary Combination of PANI and the cost-effective graphite can obtain composites with good electrochemical performance. For the synthesis method of in-situ polymerization of aniline in presence of GNP, the type and content of oxidant can affect the electrochemical properties of PANI/GNP composites. Besides, the addition of excess dopant can influence the electrochemical properties of a PANI-dominated system. The two eco-friendly reduction ways, namely polymerization of dopamine and adding TA, both produced graphite with good dispersion stability and enhanced interaction with PANI. But the reduction effect of dopamine polymerization was weak, and the non-conductivity of PDA has negative effect on the electrochemical performance of the composites. Using the environmental friendly TA is an effective and facile way to produce cost-effective PANI/graphite composites for supercapacitor purpose. Comparing the two types of graphite, rGO showed lower conductivity and more defects in the carbonaceous structure compared to GNP. In my study, the PANI/(GNP-TA) (1:0.1) composites, which was prepared by using APS as oxidant and without dopant, exhibited the highest capacitive ability. In a three-electrode testing system, the PANI/(GNP-TA) composite showed a high specific capacitance of 351.2 F g-1 at 10 mV s 1. The corresponding two-electrode solid-state supercapacitor device exhibited a promising energy density of 2.3 Wh kg-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which was comparable to the commercially available supercapacitors (around 5 Wh kg-1). But for application the rate capability of the composite needs to be enhanced, in order to maintain the good capacitive performance at high current density",
