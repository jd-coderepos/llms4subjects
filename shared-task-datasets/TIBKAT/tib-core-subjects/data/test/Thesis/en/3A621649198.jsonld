                "Aim of the present study was to investigate the degradation of phenylalkanes by eukaryotic microorganisms, especially fungi. Major interest of this study was directed to the yeast Trichosporon asahii SBUG-Y 833. Further analysis were carried out with Candida maltosa SBUG-Y 700, Trichosporon mucoides SBUG-Y 801, and nine filamentous fungi of the genera Cunninghamella, Fusarium, Lecanicillium, Mucor, Penicillium, Sporothrix and Umbelopsis. Phenylalkanes were used as substrates with five to ten and twelve carbon atoms in the alkyl side chain. To characterize the degradation and transformation capacities of the yeasts, especially of T. asahii, biotransformation experiments with phenylalkane derivatives and aromatic acids were additionally carried out. Candida maltosa 1. The alkane-assimilating yeast C. maltosa was able to use phenylalkanes (0.5 %) with side chain length of at least 8 carbon atoms as growth substrates. 2. In biotransformation experiments with odd-chain phenylalkanes (phenylheptane, phenylnonane) benzoic acid was continuously extracellularly accumulated. Phenylalkanes with an even number of carbon atoms in the alkyl side chain (phenylhexane, phenyloctane, phenyldecane and phenyldodecane) were degraded via 4 phenylbutanoic acid and 4-phenyl-3-butenoic acid to phenylacetic acid which was accumulated extracellularly analogous to benzoic acid ...",
