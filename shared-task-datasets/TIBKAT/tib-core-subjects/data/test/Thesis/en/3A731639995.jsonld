                "Abstract Atmospheric Pressure Discharges have attracted much interest in recent years. The development of a new processes based on this discharge needs a clear understanding of plasma and discharge physics and chemistry. At the present time much attention is paid to the chemical processes in barrier discharge plasma in various gas mixtures, since the understanding of these processes is necessary for the development of industrial reactors. Besides these, hydrocarbons are being used for the formation of diamond like or amorphous carbon (DLC) films. Specially, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C: H) and plasma polymerization. In this work we have used Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) a plasma device used to investigate simple hydrocarbon reactions in a plasma phase. Our aim of plasma phase chemical reaction studies is to form molecular hydrogen, higher order hydrocarbons CnHm up to n ? 12 series and nitrogen - containing organic complexes using simple hydrocarbons. Deposition of thin organic films or DLC films were carried out using the DBD. In this study we have chosen certain combination of gases such as C2Hm/N2 (m = 2, 4, 6) and C2Hm/Ar (m = 2, 4, 6); the purpose of using N2 and Ar gases are to dilute and stabilize the hydrocarbon plasma and to investigate plasma chemical reactions with nitrogen gas. All reactions were carried out under an atmospheric pressure (300 mbar) with gas ratio 1:2; Experiments were performed by applying high voltage with a frequency 5.5 kHz ...",
