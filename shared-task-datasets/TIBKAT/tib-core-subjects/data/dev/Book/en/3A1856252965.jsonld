            "abstract": "\"The main part of the book consists of the dialogue between physicist Otto R\u00f6ssler, and artist and AI researcher Bill Seaman with the commentaries disclosing information perspective by information scientist Mark Burgin and Bill Seaman. In this dialogue, R\u00f6ssler and Seaman discuss concepts surrounding R\u00f6ssler's major research over his lifetime. Additionally, each research topic is linked to the set of papers and books published by R\u00f6ssler and other related collaborative researchers. The goal is to delineate an intellectual directory for future researchers. The discussed topics being transdisciplinary in nature cross many fields in science and technology. A comprehensive historical bibliography is also included. The work explores many fields germane to theoretical science as R\u00f6ssler was often quite early in developing these fields and interacting with many famous scientists. This work pertains to information theory, which has often been left out of the historical literature. Burgin as an expert in information theory is providing an information perspective on this dialogue adding historical discussion and relevant scientific and mathematical underpinnings of the discussed ideas. His observations are complemented by Seaman, who presents the synthesis of artistic and scientific outlook. Addendum contains articles describing R\u00f6ssler's relationships to colleagues from multiple fields, a parable by R\u00f6ssler and papers related to R\u00f6ssler's research and theoretical models of processes in the universe\"--",
