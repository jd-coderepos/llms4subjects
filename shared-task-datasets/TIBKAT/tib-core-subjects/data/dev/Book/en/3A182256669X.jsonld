            "abstract": "\"In current digital era, information is an important asset for our daily life as well as for small and large-scale businesses. The network technologies are the main enablers that connect the computing devices and resources together to collect, process and share the vital information locally as well as globally. The network technologies provide efficient, flexible and seamless communication while maximizing productivity and resources for our day-to-day life and business operations. For all these importance, this domain has been evolved drastically in the last few decades from the traditional wired networks to the Bluetooth, Infrared, Micro-waves, Radio-waves and Satellite networks. Now a days, network technologies are not only restricted to computer laboratories, offices or homes, many other diverse areas have been witnessed where network technologies are being used based on the applications and needs such as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks, Under-water Networks, and Internet of Things. Along with the hardware-based and physical network technologies, a lot of research works have been carried out by the researchers from academia and industry to develop the emerging software-based network technologies such as network software architectures, middleware, and protocol stacks. The software-based network technologies become the main driving force behind the paradigm shift in this domain and have invented many new network technologies such as grid computing, cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, software defined networks, content centric networks and so on. On the other hand, a lot of efforts have been made in cellular network technologies to improve the user experience and as a consequence, emerging cellular network technologies like LTE, VoLTE and 5G have been invented. Due to its demand and importance in the present and future scenarios, numerous efforts have been done in the networking domain by the researchers, a lot of works are still ongoing, and many more possibilities have still to be explored. Therefore, there is a need to keep track of advancements related to the network technologies and further investigate several research challenges to overcome for the ease of users. With this goal, the book provides most recent and prominent research works have been done related to the network technologies\"--",
