                "Takes an interdisciplinary approach to contribute to the ongoing development of human-AI interaction.Current debate and development of AI is \"algorithm-driven\" or technical-oriented in lieu of human-centered. At present, there is no systematic interdisciplinary discussion to effectively deal with issues and challenges arising from AI.This book offers critical analysis of the logic and social implications of algorithmic processes. Reporting from the processes of scientific research, the results can be useful for understanding the relationship between algorithms and humans, allowing AI designers to assess the quality of the meaningful interactions with AI systems",
                "\"Amidst the rampant use of algorithmization enabled by AI, the common theme of AI systems is the human factor. Humans play an essential role in designing, developing, and operationalizing AI systems. We have a remit to warrant those systems run transparently, perform equitably, value our privacy, and effectively fulfill human needs. This book takes an interdisciplinary approach to contribute to the ongoing development of human-AI interaction with a particular focus on the \"human\" dimension and provides insights to improve the design of AI that could be genuinely beneficial and effectively used in society. The readers of this book will benefit by gaining insights into various perspectives about how AI has impacted people and society and how it will do so in future, and understanding how we can design algorithm systems that are beneficial, legitimate, usable by humans, and designed considering and respecting human values. This book provides a horizontal set of guidelines and insight into how humans can be empowered by making choices about AI designs that allow them meaningful control over AI. Designing meaningful AI experiences has garnered great attention to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable the proper attribution of responsibility to humans. This book helps us understand the possibilities of what AI systems can do and how they can and should be integrated into our society\"--"
