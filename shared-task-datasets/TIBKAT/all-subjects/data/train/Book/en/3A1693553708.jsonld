            "abstract": "\"This book is an essential manual for professionals and students who wish to deepen their knowledge of food additives that modify the texture of food, thickeners and gelling agents. When it comes to food technology, hydrocolloids are generally introduced as additives. Other ingredients, not considered additives, are also hydrocolloids, for example proteins and starches. This manual only focuses on those considered additives, except modified starches. Newly translated from Spanish to English, Hydrocolloids in Food Product Development is written by four experts in their field who are familiar with offering technical advice to companies related to the manufacturing of food. After an introductory chapter that reviews chemical characteristics, the hydration and solubilization of hydrocolloids, the preparation of hydrocolloids solutions, and technological functions, subsequent chapters present different hydrocolloids used in food technology and describe its technical features and its most common uses. Key Features: Describes technical and utilization characteristics of thickeners and gelling agents Details the origin, physical-chemical characteristics, form of use, function, synergies, incompatibilities and examples of use Graphs, tables, photographs and diagrams provided in full color for easy reading comprehension This practical manual is designed so that food industry technicians and chefs may easily consult while doing their daily work, or so that students of degrees related to food technology may use it as a reference book\"--",
