The collection is marked by its rich discussion, cohesive lines of argument, and interdisciplinary range.\" --Mark Knight, Professor, Lancaster University, UK \"The Figure of Christ in the Long Nineteenth Century is a fascinating volume that fills a gap in nineteenth-century scholarship, and restores to us a sense of how central, how vigorous, and at the same time how contested, the portrayal of Christ was in this period. From the apocalyptic and visionary writing and art of Blake, to the vivid re-imaginings of novelists and childrens writers, from the poetry and art of central and established figures like Tennyson and Holman Hunt, to the radical re-appraisals of the Chartist poets, these studies show how the imaginative portrayal of Christ became a powerful way of expressing and symbolising the great themes and controversies of this period. Elizabeth Ludlow has done a fine job in selecting and editing these essays and her own work in the field also makes a strong contribution to this volume.\" -- Malcolm Guite, Chaplain of Girton College, Cambridge, UK and author, poet and singer-songwriter This book is an interdisciplinary collection of essays that explores the variety of ways in which the interface between understanding the figure of Christ, the place of the cross, and the contours of lived experience, was articulated through the long nineteenth century. Collectively, the chapters respond to the theological turn in postmodern thought by asking vital questions about the way in which representations of Christ shape understandings of personhood and of the divine",
