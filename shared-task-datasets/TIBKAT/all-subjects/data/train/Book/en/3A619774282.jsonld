Laboratory test methods and in-field applicable test methods, including precision results from inter-laboratory comparison tests, are then outlined.

                "\"Chloride ingress in reinforced concrete is a major problem, inducing corrosion and consequent spalling and structural weakness, it occurs world-wide and imposes an enormous costs. In order to guarantee the quality of expensive concrete structures and maintain them properly to achieve their designed service life, test methods and relevant models for service life prediction are required. Setting out current understanding of chloride transport mechanisms, test methods and prediction models, Resistance of Concrete to Chloride Ingress: - Describes basic mechanisms and theories - Classifies the commonly used parameters and units which express chloride and its transport properties - Outlines laboratory test methods and in-field test methods including precision results from inter-laboratory comparison tests - Explains some of the fundamentals of models - Analyses the different types of models theoretically and critically - Uses analytical and probabilistic approaches are used to analyse the sensitivity of various models - Presents and discusses the results from a benchmarking evaluation of different models - Gives guidelines for the practical use of test methods and models, including tests for in-situ applications, and test methods validated by the precision results are detailed in an Appendix. Providing practising engineers, designers, researchers, advanced students and other professionals with a useful reference for analysis and design of concrete structures exposed to chloride environments, the book draws on the Chlortest project, which involved seventeen partners from ten European countries, and will serve as an authoritative guide for some time to come\"--"
