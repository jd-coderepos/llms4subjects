            "abstract": "\"This is the third edition of a popular introductory guide to the function and future of the air cargo supply chain, an industry which responded with remarkable efficiency when faced with the challenges and impact of the Covid19 pandemic. The book reviews the role and strategy of air cargo and its contribution to world trade and international economies. This industry, which accounts for more than 35 percent of the world's trade in value, will be even more vital in the coming years. Building on the success of previous editions, Air Cargo Management now puts the emphasis on basic functionality, economics, and historical precedents, but most of all it focuses on how traditional legacy methods are being replaced by the adoption of technologies and cloud based applications, new methods which are changing and streamlining the entire industry. The book reviews the supply chain process and the technology applications as well as the effects of the pandemic and the fundamental lack of cargo capacity hitherto supplied by passenger aircraft. It also explores the increased use of freighter aircraft and the need for faster and more efficient processing, particularly on the ground and in road transport. The third edition features new content on. Security and crime, including pharmaceutical counterfeiting and fraud. The role of airports and road feeder services. Typical air cargo products, including the heavy-lift sector. Regulations and treaties. Aircraft in use, historically and currently. New technologies. The book is illustrated with statistical evidence, examples and photographs and is enriched with comments from industry leaders and experienced professionals. The style and breadth of content is designed to be easily readable and should be of practical interest to anyone either currently working in the logistics, supply chain, or transport industries or contemplating a career in this sector\".",
