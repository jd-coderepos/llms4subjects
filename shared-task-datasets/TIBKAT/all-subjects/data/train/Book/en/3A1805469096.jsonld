                "\"Energy demand will increase by 70% by the year of 2030, and with the continual day-by-day depletion of traditional energy sources, there is a vast need to continue the development of dependable renewable energy sources that are locally available and that enhance energy generation efficiency. This important resource, Deregulated Electricity Market: A Smart Grid Perspective, presents the topical issues of the deregulated electricity market, focusing on the integration of renewable sources with engineering approaches. The volume identifies and explores the deregulated electricity market s and looks at different renewable generation techniques and their operation and control issues. It considers the various power quality issues with renewable energy generation interfaced with smart grids and their solution techniques. It also addresses the various integration challenges of the energy storage systems and energy management of electric vehicles in the smart grid environment. Topics include methods for frequency, angle, and voltage monitoring in smart grids; load frequency and voltage control pricing; grid integration of wind energy generation systems; tracking and management techniques; performance analysis; and more. This volume is an important resource for scientists, researchers, students, and academicians across the globe concerned with adopting and implementing novel research on smart power grids and renewable energy systems\"--"
