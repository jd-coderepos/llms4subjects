                "\"The present book belongs to the book series of \"Computer Aided Bridge Engineering\" for the design of pre-stressed concrete (PSC), I-girder (I-Beam), and PSC box-girder bridges. In this volume, the real project design calculations for a deck-girder superstructure are presented along with the design of an abutment and pier with pile foundation as the bridge substructure. The book is proposed to be read in association with processing the design work by using the computer software ASTRA Pro as referred to in the book. The book describes two essential facets of the work, which are 'Analysis of the Grillage Model of the Deck-Girder Superstructure' and the subsequent 'Design of Deck Slab and PSC I-Girder'. The software provides three facets of the work: first is the 'Analysis of the Grillage Model of the Deck-Girder Superstructure', second is the 'Design of Deck Slab and PSC I-Girder, Abutment, Piers along with Pile Foundation', and the third is a 'Set of Sample Editable CAD Drawings for the work'. The drawings may be modified as per the design work and be submitted as required for the construction. The drawings contain information on dimensions, structural detailing, bar-bending schedules, pre-stressing details and construction guides\""
