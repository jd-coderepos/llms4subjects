            "abstract": "\"Carbon Nanotubes for a Green Environment: Balancing the Risks and Rewards describes the synthesis, characterization, and unique applications of undoped/doped carbon nanotubes as well as hybrids of them with grapheme or nanocomposites, focusing on green aspects of carbon nanotube applications. The volume shows new approaches used for tapping the potential and promise of key materials in isolation or combined with other materials. The research-oriented chapters highlight a spectrum of applications of carbon nanotubes as novel materials for energy storage as well as for environmental remediation, wastewater treatment, green health care products, and more. Chapters explore the use of carbon nanotubes for remediation methods for wastewater treatment such as by using graphene oxide-carbon nanotube composites and by applying undoped and doped carbon nanotubes for removing contaminates. The book also looks at the application of carbon nanotubes for enhanced oil recovery and for heavy metal separation. Other chapters look at the rheological behavior of carbon nanotubes-based materials and their role in processing for various products, the thermal and electrical transport in carbon nanotubes composites, and carbon nanotubes-based composite materials for electromagnetic shielding applications. The biomedical applications of carbon nanotube-based nanomaterials is also explored, such as FTIR spectroscopy\"--",
