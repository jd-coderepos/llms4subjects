                "The Nordic countries are admired for their modern design sophistication, but their contemporary gardens and landscapes are less well known. Against a high-latitude backdrop of deep winters, long summer days and raking light, the Scandinavian countries - each in its distinct manner - have produced particular responses to planting, landscaping and the relationship between home and garden. Features the most inspiring examples in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland, and brings new ideas for creating modern outdoor spaces no matter where you live.--",
                "Few people have difficulty conjuring images of modern Scandinavian design, whose influence over the past century has reached around the world. More difficult for many is imagining the quiet landscapes of the Nordic countries, which range from the flatlands of Denmark to the dramatic mountains and fjords of Norway. These majestic environments, combined with long summer days and light-poor winters, raking light and dense birch forests, have given rise to exceptionally refined examples of garden and landscape design. This thematic survey presents the best gardens to have been produced over the past ten years. Organized by themes that encapsulate the special ambiance and lifestyle of the Scandinavian countries - Simplicity, Silence, Fragility, Nakedness, Attunement, Boldness, Openness and Care - each garden is presented through images and texts explaining its unique aspects and describing its particularly Scandinavian characteristics. The timelessness of Nordic design has proven itself around the world for many decades. Now it is time for the quality of its gardens and landscapes to come into the light. --"
