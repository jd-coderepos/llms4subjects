            "abstract": "Offers a path for library managers through the language and processes that they need to understand as members of a team overseeing the planning of a new library building project, major refurbishment or remodelling of an existing library, Libraries today are faced with rapidly shifting populations of users with differing needs who require a range of new communications links that are transforming our concept of library space. This developing role has created a set of new and complex challenges for those delivering library buildings and services. There is no such thing as the 'perfect' library building. However, a well designed building may enable a project both to gain local acceptance more easily and to ease the process of securing planning permission. It also needs be cheap to run, to support the organization well and to offer an improved service to the user. This much-needed book takes as its starting point the fact that few architects know very much about libraries, and fewer librarians know anything about architectural planning. It steers a clear path for library managers through the language and processes that they need to understand as members of a team overseeing the planning of a new library building project, major refurbishment or remodelling of an existing library. The key topics include: twenty-first century libraries; developing a business case; project management; the design/project team; selecting an architect; partnership and community engagement; the design brief; design quality; space planning and access; and, occupancy and post-occupancy evaluation. This is an invaluable guide not only for new entrants to the library profession, but also for experienced practitioners who are approaching for the first time the important task of creating a new library or major refurbishment of existing facilities",
