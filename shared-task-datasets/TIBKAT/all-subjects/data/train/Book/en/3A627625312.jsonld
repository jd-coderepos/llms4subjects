It emphasizes the properties of magnesium-based composites and the effects of different types of reinforcements, from micron length to nanometer scale, on the properties of the resulting composites. With the popularity of magnesium-based materials in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and sports equipment industries, and its unique role as a lightweight, energy-saving and high-performance material, both professionals and students will find this a must-have resource\"--",

While many books and reviews have been written on magnesium-based materials and the technology of magnesium, there has not been a consolidated book on the properties of other futuristic magnesium-based materials, in particular magnesium-based composites that have been developed actively over the last 15 years. Since magnesium is the lightest of all structural metals, and due to its low density and high specific mechanical properties, it has become a popular material for applications in the automotive, aerospace, electronics and sports equipment industries\"--"
