                "\"Developments in and applications of laser spectroscopy and laser imaging are growing rapidly, specifically now that spectral analytical methodologies are merging with laser imaging techniques. There are now a wide range of established techniques having applications in many fields of chemistry and physics. The range of applications and techniques often makes it difficult for potential new users to come to an educated decision whether a particular technique may be suitable for his particular problem. It is the intention of this book to provide researchers, both in industry and academia, with a concise collection of laser analysis and imaging techniques. Though there are several books in specific areas of laser spectroscopy, there is a lack of a recent single volume publication providing a solid overview of the field as present texts are now dated in this fast moving field. Written by two leaders in the field it will introduce the reader to individual techniques in a tutorial-fashion; providing key examples and including details of the latest techniques. Though not written as a grad text it has potential to be used for a range of grad courses as well\"--",
