            "abstract": "\"Wheat: Environment, Food and Health will begin with an overview of the current importance of wheat for food security and explanations of how and why this prominence has occurred. Coverage will include evolutionary and historical perspectives; the adaptability of wheat; the unique qualities of wheat grain; the investments in production, breeding and processing technologies; and factors related to wheat being a globally traded commodity. The reader will be introduced to the impacts that the wheat crop can have on the environment, the challenges that environmental change will pose for meeting demand, and the various effects that wheat consumption can have on human health. Subsequent chapters will deal in detail with factors introduced in the above. Specifically, sections will deal with how wheat is grown, how production methods are influenced by environment and climate change, and how production affects environment (in terms of use of non-renewable resources, diffuse pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, soil quality, and biodiversity). Methods of reducing environmental impact will include those to improve the efficiency with which resources (land and soils, water, nutrients, and light) are used. The bases and methods of sustainable production philosophies such as 'organic', conservation' and 'climate-smart' agriculture will be explained\"--",
