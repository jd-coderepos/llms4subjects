                "\"Fluid film bearings are machine elements that should be studied within the broader context of tribology. The three subfields of tribology - friction, lubrication, and wear - are strongly interrelated. The last decade has witnessed significant advances in the area of fluid film lubrication and its applications, and this second edition offers a look at some of these advances. This edition adds onto the fundamentals of fluid film lubrication a discourse on surface effects and the inclusion of treatment of flow with significant inertia within the section on turbulence. Basic ideas of the multigrid method are conveyed along with multilevel multi-integration in the treatment of elastohydrodynamic lubrication. The chapter on lubrication with non-Newtonian fluids discusses the impact of the so-named qualitative EHL. This chapter also contains a thorough discussion of blood as a lubricant, with a view of the application of lubrication theory to LVADs. New chapters have been included on ultra-thin films, both liquid and gaseous, and lubrication of articulating joints and their replacement. Some of the most recent literature is discussed\"--Provided by publisher",
                "\"The term tribology, meaning the science and technology of friction, lubrication, and wear, is of recent origin (Lubrication EngineeringWorking Group, 1966), but its practical aspects reach back to prehistoric times. The importance of tribology has greatly increased during its long history, and modern civilization is surprisingly dependent on sound tribological practices. The field of tribology affects the performance and life of all mechanical systems and provides for reliability, accuracy, and precision of many. Tribology is frequently the pacing item in the design of new mechanical systems. Energy loss through friction in triboelements is a major factor in limits on energy efficiency. Strategic materials are used in many tribo-elements to obtain the required performance\"--Provided by publisher"
