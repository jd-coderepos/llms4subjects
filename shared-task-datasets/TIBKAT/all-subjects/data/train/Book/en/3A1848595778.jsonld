This book contains the cutting-edge technologies to dissipate hazardous pollutants through bio and nanotechnologies described in four sections and 18 chapters. The first section named 'The polluted environment' shows the current situation of pollution in the world, which is facing an uncontrolled emission of hazardous contaminants. The second section named 'Bioremediation' discuss updated information regarding the main biotechnologies and the use of autochthonous, introduced, or genetically modified organisms to dissipate pollutants. The third section named 'Bio or Nanoremediation' shows pioneering strategies to synthesize metal-, carbon-based, smart, or green nanomaterials and their use in bio or nanoremediation, while the molecular farming and their impact in bio or nanoremediation is also discussed. The fourth section named 'Bio and Nanoremediation working together for better performance' explain the mains chemical and biochemical processes involved in degradation of hazardous contaminants through bio and nanoremediation, and exhibit state-of-the-art strategies regarding the environmental remediation by novel nanomaterials working together with bacteria, fungi or plants at high-degradation rates of hazardous contaminants. An up to date book for undergraduate or postgraduate students, and scientists or researchers involved in nanoscience, nanotechnology, and bioremediation technology as well as those researchers that solving environmental problems regarding the management and degradation of pollutants that jeopardize the human and environmental health and hamper the pursuit of the sustainable development goals\"--",
