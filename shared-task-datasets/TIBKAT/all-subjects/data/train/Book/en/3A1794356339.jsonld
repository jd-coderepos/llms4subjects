                "This book contains a rich resource of essential information on the water resources capacities in Poland. This book contributes to the recognition of water resources management including extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts. The book incorporates case studies illustrating solutions of water quantity management in Poland. This edited book covers all water bodies in the country including rivers, lakes, reservoirs and groundwater. The novelty of this book is that it represents the first time a manuscript covers the assessment of water resources in Poland, including variability, availability and economic use of the hydrological resources in the country with the lowest renewable resources of surface water per inhabitant in Europe. Given the depth and breadth of its coverage, the book offers engineers, researchers, policy planners, decision makers, and stakeholders essential new insights into efficient water resources management. .",
