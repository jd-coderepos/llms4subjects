In this unique new book, John Manners-Bell will include a section on the key trends affecting development of emerging markets; the social, economic and political context; the reasons behind their integration within the global trading economy; the main challenges (security, corruption, transport infrastructure).

He includes individual sections on the BRIC transport and logistics sectors, as well as prospects for Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. He also provides a survey section showing the best markets to invest in and a downloadable index comparing the world's major developing logistics markets on a number of different metrics identifying the key attributes that make the markets an attractive investment proposition. \"--"
