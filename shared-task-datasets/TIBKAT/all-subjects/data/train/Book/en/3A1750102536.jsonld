            "abstract": "The book provides process engineers, an insight into refractories focusing on its importance and requirements in chemical process industries such as refinery and petrochemicals, syngas manufacturing, coal gasification, limestone calcinations, carbon black, glass, and cement production. Additionally the book discusses the refractory requirements for the CFBC boiler, and waste heat utilization process to generate steam. The book describes characterization of refractory material and selection process of the refractory for lining different equipments pertaining to the chemical process industry. The book covers refractory installation techniques, and the precautions to be taken during installation are discussed in detail along with the theoretical background. It explains the physical and chemical factors that influence the performances of refractory, mechanism of its degradation in service and emphasizes on the thermo-chemical and thermo-mechanical aspects and their role in that process . The content lays out different methods of monitoring Refractory lining conditions while the furnace is in operation and also elucidates few methods to repair the worn out lining without taking a shutdown. The scheme of investigation of a refractory failure is an added feature. Discusses operational conditions prevailing in different reactors, furnaces, and kilns and any other equipment subjected to high temperature exposure; Illustrates the decision making process on selection of refractories as protection lining; Presents in detail the different types of thermal insulation materials important for all process chemical industries; Elucidates particulars of the installation procedure of refractories and insulation materials focussing their bearing on the performance of the refractories; Analyzes the factors responsible for refractory performances and the various investigation procedures in case of refractory failure; Features case studies on the monitoring and failure of refractories in r eactors or furnaces or in other equipment in various chemical process industries",
