Data as driver.This book offers us the chance to become informed and knowledgeable pursuers of data and the opportunities it offers to making architecture a wonderful, useful, and smart art form.\" --From the Foreword by James Timberlake, FAIA Written for architects, engineers, contractors, owners, and educators, and based on today's technology and practices, Data-Driven Design and Construction: 25 Strategies for Capturing, Applying and Analyzing Building Data     addresses how innovative individuals and firms are using data to remain competitive while advancing their practices.  seeks to address and rectify a gap in our learning, by explaining to architects, engineers, contractors and owners--and students of these fields--how to acquire and use data to make more informed decisions.  documents how data-driven design is the new frontier of the convergence between BIM and architectural computational analyses and associated tools.  is a book of adaptable strategies you and your organization can apply today to make the most of the data you have at your fingertips.  Data-Driven Design and Construction was written to help design practitioners and their project teams make better use of BIM, and leverage data throughout the building lifecycle\"--",
