            "abstract": "\"This book gives reader a brief idea about the processes involved in fabric formation methods namely weaving and knitting including various mechanisms involved starting from the primitive handlooms to the latest shuttle less loom and from the hand knitting to ultra-modern electronic knitting machines. Various design aspects involved in producing the different types of woven and knitted fabrics are dealt with comprehensively. Techno-economics of the latest weaving and knitting machines have been described including applications of woven and knitted fabrics for medical field, automotive engineering, aeronautical engineering, protective clothing, and so forth. Covers principles involved in the numerous operations of weaving and knitting process. Gives basic understanding of fabric production, quality control and production. Provides summary of the fabric manufacturing process of weaving, knitting and non-wovens. Discusses principles of mechanisms as well as the present-day machinery details with illustrations. Explores latest development on knitting production by whole garment (Shima Seiki) and Knit and Wear (Stoll), CAD/CAM production and simulation of woven fabrics. This book aims at Senior Undergraduate students in Textile Processing and Fabric Manufacturing\"",
