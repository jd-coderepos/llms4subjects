                "This book gathers a collection of essays that describe recent innovations in food technology including food processing, packaging, food safety, and novel ingredients. By 2050, the world will face the challenge of having to feed an estimated 9 billion people. In order to meet that challenge, innovations in food research are of the utmost importance. The book is divided into four sections, each of which explores an important aspect like food processing, food microbiology, and nutritional security. Written by respected scholars in the field, the respective chapters discuss a range of new and enhanced food materials, as well as processing innovations to extend shelf life and reduce toxic effects. The book also addresses the health potential of various nutraceuticals, bio-absorption of metals and their positive impacts on living systems, as well as methods for reducing food wastage, preventing the loss of nutritive value, and preserving or enhancing palatability. Given its scope, the book will be highly interesting for food scientists, both in academia and the food industry. It will also benefit advanced graduate students and senior researchers.",
