                "This contributed volume reviews the latest advances on relevant 3D tissue engineered in vitro models of disease making use of biomaterials and microfluidics. The main focus of this book is on advanced biomaterials and microfluidics technologies that have been used in in vitro mimetic 3D models of human diseases and show great promise in revolutionizing personalized medicine. Readers will discover important topics involving biomaterials and microfluidics design, advanced processing techniques, and development and validation of organ- and body-on-a-chip models for bone, liver, and cancer research. An in depth discussion of microfabrication methods for microfluidics development is also provided. This work is edited by two truly multidisciplinary scientists and includes important contributions from well-known experts in their fields. The work is written for both early stage and experienced researchers, and well-established scientists enrolled in the fields of biomaterials, microfluidics, and tissue engineering, and is especially suited to those who wish to become acquainted with the principles and latest developments of in vitro models of diseases, such as professionals working in pharma, medicine, and engineering.",
