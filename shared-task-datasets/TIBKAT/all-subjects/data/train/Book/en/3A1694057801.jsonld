                "This book is Open Access under a CC BY license. Asia\u2019s recent demographic transitions and rural\u2013urban structural transformations are extraordinary and involve complexities that require in-depth study. The chapters within this volume examine those complexities using a range of traditional and nontraditional measures\u2014such as multidimensional poverty, gaps, and polarization\u2014to arrive at the conclusion that poverty is now an urban issue. This volume offers an essential resource for economic policy makers and students of development economics to understand the interrelationships between internal migration, urbanization, and poverty in Asia, paving the way for the improved management of internal migration, and disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.
