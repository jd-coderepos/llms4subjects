                "\"This book volume sheds light on the health benefits of selected cereal grains, processing technologies of cereals, specific roles of bioactive compounds of cereals in chronic disease prevention, and traditional and latest technologies to improve the functional benefits of cereal-based products. It presents a thorough review of the functional components of some lesser known or forgotten cereals and their role in maintaining good health. With advancements in cereal science and technology, new methods of processing have emerged that help to preserve or even enhance the health-benefitting properties of cereal grains. Further, plant breeding and biotechnology have contributed greatly in improving nutritional quality and functionality of these grains. This book provides comprehensive information on the simple as well as advanced methodologies for enhancing the properties of cereals that benefit human health. Some new approaches such as bio-fortification and extraction of bioactives from cereals are also included in the text. Cereals and Cereal-Based Foods: Functional Benefits and Technological Advances for Nutrition and Healthcare looks at the current scenario of the research in cereals and cereal-based products and covers the importance of pseudocereals, whole grains, and multigrain under four main parts: Functional Benefits of Cereal Grains discusses the health benefits of some selected grains that constituted staple food in the past but have lost their importance in the modern times. Technological Advances in Cereals covers new approaches in the processing of cereals that ensure maximum retention of health-benefitting components of cereal grains. Novel Strategies to Enhance Bioactives in Cereals integrates traditional as well as modern technologies with new approaches for improving functional benefits of cereal based foods. Role of Cereals in Disease Management elaborates on the specific role of cereal bioactives in prevention of some chronic diseases. This book will serve as a useful reference for teachers and students as well as those who are involved in research on development of functional products from cereal grains. It would also benefit technologists and industrialists engaged in health food manufacture\"--"
