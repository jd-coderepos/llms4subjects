This  deceptively simple question is the single most important problem facing  science as we probe more deeply into the fundamentals of the universe.  All of the mysteries physicists and cosmologists face--from the Big Bang  to the future of the universe, from the puzzles of quantum physics to  the unification of forces and particles--come down to the nature of time.  The  fact that time is real may seem obvious. You experience it passing  every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow.  But most physicists, from Newton to Einstein to today's quantum  theorists, have seen things differently. The scientific case for time  being an illusion is formidable. That is why the consequences of  adopting the view that time is real are revolutionary.  Lee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller The Trouble with Physics,  argues that a limited notion of time is holding physics back. It's time  for a major revolution in scientific thought. The reality of time could  be the key to the next big breakthrough in theoretical physics.  What if the laws of physics themselves were not timeless? What if they could evolve? Time Reborn  offers a radical new approach to cosmology that embraces the reality of  time and opens up a whole new universe of possibilities. There are few  ideas that, like our notion of time, shape our thinking about literally  everything, with huge implications for physics and beyond--from climate  change to the economic crisis. Smolin explains in lively and lucid prose  how the true nature of time impacts our world\"--",
