            "abstract": "This book takes a fresh look at the work, thoughts, and life of 1956 Nobel Prize winner William B. Shockley. It reconstructs Shockley\u2019s upbringing, his patriotic achievements during World War II, his contribution to semiconductor physics \u2013 culminating with the epoch-making invention of the transistor \u2013 and his views on the social issues of his time. The author\u2019s unparalleled access to Shockley\u2019s personal documents provides insight into a colorful, yet controversial, man, and also sheds light on the attitudes of other prominent scientists of that era. Shockley was not only an outstanding scientist in his own right but also a fiercely independent thinker in perpetual search of the truth. His contributions to the field known today as microelectronics are enormous and unmatched. This book explores the critical facets of Shockley\u2019s life, replete with never-before-published photos and excerpts from his private correspondence and personal notebooks. The book also delves into Shockley\u2019s views on genetics and human intelligence. It tells the story of a man beset by an unrelenting rationality, slandered by the popular media, and ultimately alienated by his peers. It discusses his controversial, although sometimes prescient, ideas regarding human genetics, putting these into the context of modern research findings. Today, William Shockley is perhaps just as enigmatic as his work and accomplishments. The author presents a convincing argument that Shockley still has much to say about the issues of our age, and many of his ideas deserve evaluation in the public forum.",
