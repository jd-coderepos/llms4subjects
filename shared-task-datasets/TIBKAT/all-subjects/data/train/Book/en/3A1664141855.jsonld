                "\"The construction industry is currently experiencing accelerating developments concerning societal demands along with project complexity, internationalisation and digitalisation. In an attempt to grasp the consequences of these demands on productivity and innovation, this edited book addresses how innovation is likely to take place with a more long-term perspective on the construction sector. While existing literature focuses on organisational discontinuity and fragmentation as the main reasons for the apparent lack of innovation in the industry, this book highlights the connectivity of construction actors, resources, and activities as fundamental for understanding how innovation takes place, and how it can be pushed forward. Through 15 empirically grounded chapters, the book shows how innovation is part of construction processes on various levels, including project, firm and industry, and that these innovation processes are characterised by organisational and technological connectivity over time. Written by European business management scholars, the chapters cover empirical cases and examples from both a multi-organisational and multi-international perspective in terms of covering the viewpoints of different industry actors and the contexts of several different European countries including: Sweden, Norway, the UK, Italy, France, Hungary and Poland. By illustrating how connectivity is part of innovation processes in the creation of various innovations within and across projects as well as a fundamental aspect of the processes in which innovations cross nations, the book provides a new angle on how to understand construction innovation and where the industry mightbe heading next\"--"
