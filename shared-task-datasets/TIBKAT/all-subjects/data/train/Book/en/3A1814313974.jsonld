            "abstract": "This book illuminates a few highly significant events in history in which astronomers have helped keep contacts between astronomers of different states in moments of international political tensions or even crises. The chapters, written by 20 international authors, focus on four periods where astronomers were particularly active in international relations: 1. The WWI period, the epoch of the creation of the IAU, in the context of the simultaneous creation of other scientific unions. The book also singles out the important role of A.S. Eddington and his network \u201cacross forbidden borders\u201d. 2. The Cold war period and its consequences, when several countries were divided between opposite blocs. \u201cThe China crisis\u201d is told here from different viewpoints by Chinese astronomers, both from the mainland and from Taiwan, in parallel with the evolution of astronomy in South and North Korea. Germany\u2019s twisted path in its membership of the IAU, from its admission in 1951 to its reunification in 1991 is shown as another example. 3. The book then highlights a third period, when radio astronomers, in particular, were very active in \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d between East and West. It also tells the history of how the apparently innocuous issue of the \u201clunar nomenclature\u201d became extremely sensitive. The part ends on two chapters on Russian robotic missions and lunar surface features as well on the Russian participation in the \u201cInternational Virtual Observatory\u201d project. 4. The fourth part reports for the first time on the \u201chidden story\u201d of the relations between the IAU and the United Nations after the \u201cMoon race\u201d when the United Nations decided to challenge the IAU\u2019s authority on \u201cextraterrestrial names\u201d. The final chapter reviews how twenty years later UNESCO and the IAU had become strong partners in the difficult, but highly successful organization of the International Year of Astronomy (2002-2009), and of the \u201cAstronomy and World Heritage\u201d intitiative (2008).",
