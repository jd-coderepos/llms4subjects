            "abstract": "I investigate the function and evolution of different rice MIKC-type MADS-box genes, which due to their high variety and significance in plant development are excellent objects to study the outcome of gene duplications. Bsister MADS-box genes are known for their predominant role in plant female organ development. The rice Bsister gene OsMADS29 confers the \u2018canonical\u2019 Bsister function in rice. With a detailed comparative meta-analysis of all available Bsister gene expression patterns I underline the significance of OsMADS29-like genes within grass ovule and seed development. These genes are all very strongly and more or less exclusively expressed during ovule and/or seed development thus resembling eudicot and gymnosperm Bsister gene expression patterns. I further performed a detailed analysis of the rice gene OsMADS30 showing that it is a non-canonical Bsister gene: it has a comparatively weak and broad expression and T-DNA-insertion lines show no aberrant seed phenotype. I further demonstrated that OsMADS30 evolved under relaxed purifying selection and has a 3\u2019 region that strongly deviates from other grass Bsister genes, including closely related OsMADS30 orthologs from wild rice species. This is due to the recent insertion of a hitherto unknown transposable element. T-DNA insertion lines of OsMADS30 show diminished vegetative growth, which might be first evidence for a neo-functionalization of OsMADS30. I also studied MIKC*-type MADS-domain proteins that function in pollen development: OsMADS62, OsMADS63 and OsMADS68. I demonstrate that they bind not as homodimers but only as heterodimers to DNA. This thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of the developmental and evolutionary significance of various rice MADS-box genes. Eventually it shows how fundamentally different the results of gene duplications even within the same gene family can turn out.",
