            "title": "Work safety and religion in Indonesia",
            "abstract": "Many global surveys consistently place Indonesia as a religious country. However, religion as an agent in introducing respect for life has not been successful in striving for optimal OSH performance in Indonesia. The high rate of occupational accidents and illnesses, including those leading to death, and the low participation in labor insurance are concrete evidence. Some mainstream perspectives hypothesize that religion is one of the contributing factors due to the growth of fatalism or an attitude of resignation and helplessness in interpreting God's destiny. This study aims to prove the role of religion in Indonesia amid these issues. In addition to proving that religion is a risk factor, it also primarily explores the role of religion as a supporting factor for safety itself. Multi-methods are applied to several stages of field studies by combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. The first stage of the study found a multi-layered model of the meaning of safety, originating in the inner self with the meaning of self-existence and spinning out into social responsibility. The second study found that religious attitudes underlie the emergence of risky behavior at work, such as an attitude of resignation and \"nrima\" (absolute acceptance), absolute belief in fate, and prayer without effort. The third study found several religious values, especially Islam as Indonesia's majority religion, relevant in supporting the formation of work safety. The fourth study based on mainstream theory found fatalism, as predicted by Westerners as a source of risk, does not correlate with religious commitment. Instead, religious commitment correlates with religious work ethics that encourage the formation of safe behavior in the workplace. The conclusion results by recommending a model of collaboration and involvement of religion in improving OSH performance in companies in the context of a religious country like Indonesia.",
