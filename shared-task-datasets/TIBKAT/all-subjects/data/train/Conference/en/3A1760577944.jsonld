                "This book comes out of the 12th Iberoamerican Congress of Food Engineering, which took place at the University of Algarve in Faro, Portugal in July 2019. It includes the editors' selection of the best research works from oral and poster presentations delivered at the conference. The first section is dedicated to research carried out on SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES TO CHEMICAL ADDITIVES TO EXTEND SHELF LIFE, with special emphasis on animal products. The second section discusses recent research in SUSTAINABLE NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. The third section delves into the development of PLANT-BASED ALTERNATIVES TO DAIRY AND GLUTEN BASED CEREALS. The fourth section tackles CONSUMER BEHAVIOR regarding food products with new sources of protein (e.g. insects) or new sources of important nutrients (e.g. seaweeds) and the fifth discusses the VALORIZATION OF BY-PRODUCTS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY (from fruits and wine making). For food engineers, food technologists, and food scientists looking to stay up-to-date in this field of sustainable food engineering, Sustainable Innovation in Food Product Design is the ideal resource.",
