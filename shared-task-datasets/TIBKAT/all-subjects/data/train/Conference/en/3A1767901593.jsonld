                "This book includes a collection of research and practical papers aiming with key priority for improving the infrastructural sustainability for our well-being and day-to-day lives through novel developments. The united efforts through new developments in material, design, construction, maintenance, and testing of pavements from all over the world are taken under one umbrella. Topics include issues related to civil infrastructure such as the use of construction waste, recycled aggregates, service life prediction of pavements, mechanical behavior of SMA, control measures of ready mixed concrete, determination of landslide high-risk areas, Simulation of rock hydraulics in rock joint, sustainable planning for provision of basic infrastructural facilities in rural areas. It is anticipated that this book will support decisions regarding the optimal management and maintenance of civil infrastructures to support a more resilient and sustainable environment for infrastructure users. ."
