This forum was the culmination of more than three decades of academic and industrial activities of Iranian scholars and professionals, and the participation of many notable international scientists, in covering various important polymer-related subjects of concern to Iran and the world at large, including polymer synthesis, processing and properties, as well as issues concerning polymer degradation, stability, and environmental aspects. For the past half a century, the growing concern for advancing human health, quality of life, and \u2013 especially in the last few decades \u2013 avoiding and combating environmental pollution have shaped and driven scientific activities geared toward the creation of smart materials that are compatible with the human body, and have prompted scientists and technologists to pursue research using natural and sustainable sources. This book highlights efforts to responsibly address the problems caused by, and which can potentially be solved by, polymers and plastics. .",
