                "Through research and proven practice, the aim of the International Conference of Sustainable Ecological Engineering Design for Society (SEEDS) is to foster ideas on how to reduce negative impacts on the environment while providing for the health and well-being of society. The professions and fields of research required to ensure buildings meet user demands and provide healthy enclosures are many and diverse. The SEEDS conference addresses the interdependence of people, the built and natural environments, and recognizes the interdisciplinary and international themes necessary to assemble the knowledge required for positive change. Presents leading-edge research at the intersection of sustainability, ecology, engineering, and design Energy, building performance, and physics research is examined within the context of health, life quality, and ecology Covers energy efficiency, modeling energy performance, retrofitting, lighting, green materials, low-carbon building design, lean construction, and historical preservation."
