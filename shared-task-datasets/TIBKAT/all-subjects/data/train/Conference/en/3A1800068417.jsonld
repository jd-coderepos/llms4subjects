                "This book covers several research outcomes of various fields and schools related to maritime operation, applications and materials science. Thirty-four research papers have been compiled from the 2nd International Conference on Marine and Advanced Technologies 2021 (ICMAT 2021) which was organized by the Research and Innovation Section of the Universiti Kuala Lumpur-MIMET. The chapters were written by experienced lecturers from various universities in Malaysia discussing various topics and sub-topics related to maritime engineering and materials science. These chapters portray the actual knowledge on the latest developments and trends of technologies in maritime industries. .",
