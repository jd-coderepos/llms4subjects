            "abstract": "The objective of the interdisciplinary RETRO project supported by the German Federal Ministry for Educationand Research (BMBF) was to analyze current practice in planning procedures in terms of their ICZMcompatibility by means of a retrospective analysis of 10 large-scale project approval and planning procedures inthe German coastal zone so as to be able to provide guidelines for the implementation of ICZM in Germany onthis basis. Since the requirements for good ICZM practice have not been adequately specified to date, wedeveloped 17 criteria for good ICZM practice using, in particular, the existing EU ICZM papers as the basis.The focus here is on the procedural aspects of negotiation and integration as well as the material aspects of arelative strengthening of ecological sustainability. We operationalized the criteria through formulation of 55assessable indicators. This set of indicators for good ICZM practice can be used beyond the RETROframework as a basis for discussion in connection with the implementation of ICZM.The analysis of planning practice and of the underlying legal tools, which was conducted with an eye to ICZMcompatibility on the basis of the indicators, shows in a synopsis that the set of planning tools established in theGerman coastal region meets in part the ICZM demands for negotiation, integration and appropriateconsideration of the ecological aspects of sustainability. In view of this background, the implementation ofICZM in Germany should, in our view, be carried out on the basis of the existing legal planning framework.However, the analysis also revealed substantial deficits.Therefore, implementation of ICZM in Germany is notpossible without a number of adaptations and extensions ofthe planning tools, which are designated asrecommendations for action. In addition to the required broadening ofthe opportunities for participation, therecommendations focus especially on significant strengthening and extension of regional planning in generaland of the regional planning procedure in particular. A number of recommendations, such as that for relativereinforcement of the ecological aspect of sustainability and for improvement of territorial integration, also referbeyond planning processes to more fundamental aspects of the governmental and political decision-makingsystem.",
