            "abstract": "The present work deals with the design and the realisation of a flexible trailing edge system. Goal of the flexible trailing edge system witch consists of a smooth variable cambering is the improvement of the aerodynamic performance for future airliner. The 'Hornconcept' is introduced. Several of hornlike shaped structures are rotatable mounted at a rigid leading edge box of the flap structure. The hornlike structures are covered with a flexible skin structure. The upper and lower skin is connected with flexible webs which gives stiffness in spanwise direction. By turning the horns, the skin structure is forced to adapt the form of the shape of the horns. The main characteristic of the concept is the simple and robust design, the small number of moveable parts and the low necessary actuator forces. The functionality of the concept is shown with the outer flap of the A340 as a reference system. The structural behaviour (stiffness and stress) of the different components is analysed. An actuator system is selected and designed where only two actuators are necessary. The coupling of the individual horns is made with elastic rods. It is shown that such an actuator system fulfils all requirements. With the construction of a demonstrator the practical functionality is analysed. For the manufacturing of the hornlike structures with carbon fiber a special manufacturing process is developed and tested. The process is used for the assembly of the demonstrator. With lifecycle tests the stability of the structure is proved. A finite element model of the whole system with the interacting of horn structure and skin is developed. With this model and with the results of experimental analysis an optimum configuration is found by observance the stiffness requirements. It can be shown that in all load cases the stresses for the structural components are in the limits and the functionality of the concept is kept.",
