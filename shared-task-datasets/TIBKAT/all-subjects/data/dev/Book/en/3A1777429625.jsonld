            "abstract": "Designed in 2018 by Nina Edwards Anker, acclaimed architect and interior designer and founder of nea studio, the Cocoon House is a feat of sustainable design. Located in Long Island, New York, the completely unique, LEED-certified home, gets its name from the curved walls which form its cocoon-like shape. The building, which is half exposed and half opaque, also boosts beautiful skylights inspired by Goethe's colour theory, which provide sunlight-hued illuminations throughout.0'Cocoon House', a book that records every step of this ambitious project with stunning photography and insightful text, will appeal to a wide range of readers: those interested in sustainable design or the progression of solar technology in building, as well as those who are simply drawn to nature inspired statement houses, crafted with the utmost ingenuity. The carefully considered theories that served as inspiration to the house are discussed in depth, making 'Cocoon House' a crucial reference book to anyone studying sustainable architecture as a whole",
