                "This volume presents an all-inclusive overview of molecular biological methods to study ABA signaling transport, and metabolism in several plant species. The chapters in this book cover topics such as biochemical and molecular biological characterization of ABA receptors; assay systems for ABA transporters; quantification and visualization of ABA levels; and comprehensive omics approaches. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and thorough, Abscisic Acid: Methods and Protocols is a valuable resource for scientists and researchers who are interested in learning more about this developing field. ."
