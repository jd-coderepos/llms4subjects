            "abstract": "This book highlights the theories and research progress in gaseous detonation research, and proposes a universal framework theory that overcomes the current research limitations. Gaseous detonation is an extremely fast type of combustion that propagates at supersonic speed in premixed combustible gas. Being self-sustaining and self-organizing with the unique nature of pressure gaining, gaseous detonation and its gas dynamics has been an interdisciplinary frontier for decades. The research of detonation enjoyed its early success from the development of the CJ theory and ZND modeling, but phenomenon is far from being understood quantitatively, and the development of theories to predict the three-dimensional cellular structure remains a formidable task, being essentially a problem in high-speed compressible reacting flow. This theory proposed by the authors\u2019 research group breaks down the limitation of the one-dimensional steady flow hypothesis of the early theories, successfully correlating the propagation and initiation processes of gaseous detonation, and realizing the unified expression of the three-dimensional structure of cell detonation. The book and the proposed open framework is of high value for researchers in conventional applications such as coal mine explosions and chemical plant accidents, and state-of-the-art research fields such as supernova explosion, new aerospace propulsion engines, and detonation-driven hypersonic testing facilities. It is also a driving force for future research of detonation.",
