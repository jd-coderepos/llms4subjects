                "This comprehensive volume presents the topic of water resources of Mexico from a different angle. Besides covering the geohydrology it also offers a brief account of the ancient water resources works, explains from where the water is coming, how the water is being used in homes and in the industry, how the dams are operated in the hurricane season, some aspects of the water-energy-food securities nexus and the expectations for the future in connection with global climate change. The book is of interest to every one connected with the water resources of Mexico, e.g. federal and state employees of agencies related with water management, water supply and wastewater treatment. It is also of value to those in academia and employed at water related professional associations and the general public.",
