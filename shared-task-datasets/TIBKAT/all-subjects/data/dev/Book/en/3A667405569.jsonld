                "\"Preface Secure digital imaging is an important research area combining methods and techniques coming from cryptography and image processing. Visual cryptography and in general secret image sharing techniques enable distributing sensitive visual materials to involved participants through public communication channels, as the generated secure images do not reveal any information if they are not combined in the prescribed way. In visual cryptography, the decoding process is performed directly by the human eyes, while in general, the shared images need some processing to reconstruct the secret image. The increasing number of possibilities to create, publish, and distribute images calls for novel protection methods, o ering new sharing and access control mechanisms for the information contained in the published images. Secure image sharing techniques overcome the traditional cryptographic approach, providing new solutions for the development of new and secure imaging applications. Since both digital imaging and privacy protection are two research themes that involve a continuously growing number of people and applications, the book focuses on secure image sharing techniques, o ering an interesting reference point for studying and developing solutions needed in such areas. This book aims to ll the existing literature gap, providing a valid guide for professional people and/or researchers interested in such elds of research. It provides a scienti cally and scholarly sound treatment of state-of-the-art techniques to students, researchers, academics, and practitioners who are interested or involved in the study, research, use, design, and development of image sharing techniques\"--Provided by publisher",
