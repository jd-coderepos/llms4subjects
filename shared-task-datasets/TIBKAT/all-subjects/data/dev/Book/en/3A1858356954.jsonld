            "abstract": "\"The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Scottish Literature is a comprehensive guide to the critical consideration of Scottish Literature through its entire history applying the most up to date critical, cultural and scholarly analyses of that literature. It aims to provide the best introductory but also advanced critical gateway to the subject. The essays each of 7,000 words in length are all by experts in the particular areas. As well as a set of end-notes, each will also feature an annotated Further Reading section of six key critical items and authoritative website addresses and other digital resources all-inclusive within essay word-length. The three sections of the Companion are designed to be comprehensive of modern perspectives on the area of Scottish Literature: historical crucial generic, thematic and also historical contexts as these are currently seen by modern literary criticism; and canonical writers. The introduction by the editor will both present and problematize canonicity, discussing the challenges raised in Scottish Literature by turns towards theory, book-history and digitality. \u00c2 This proposed publication is intended both as a historical guide to Scottish Literature and as a compendium of the most up to date critical approaches to the area. Comprehensively, it covers Scottish Literature from the 13th to the 21st centuries, with attention to the languages of Scots, English and Gaelic (as well as some consideration of Latin, French, Anglo-Saxon and other minor' linguistic contexts that necessarily inform a broad understanding of Scottish Literature). The volume ranges across periods, writers and special hot-spot topics which around which Scottish writing has congregated. The chapters will be informed, often, by literary theory, book-history and wider cultural and institutional contexts in keeping with the broad thrusts of literary scholarship in the early twenty-first century\"--",
