                "This new edition of the well established text Scheduling - Theory, Algorithms, and Systems provides an up-to-date coverage of important theoretical models in the scheduling literature as well as significant scheduling problems that occur in the real world. It again includes supplementary material in the form of slide-shows from industry and movies that show implementations of scheduling systems.  The main structure of the book as per previous edition consists of three parts. The first part focuses on deterministic scheduling and the related combinatorial problems. The second part covers probabilistic scheduling models; in this part it is assumed that processing times and other problem data are random and not known in advance. The third part deals with scheduling in practice; it covers heuristics that are popular with practitioners and discusses system design and implementation issues. All three parts of this new edition have been revamped and streamlined. The references have been made completely up-to-date. Theoreticians and practitioners alike will find this book of interest. Graduate students in operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, and computer science will find the book an accessible and invaluable resource. Scheduling - Theory, Algorithms, and Systems will serve as an essential reference for professionals working on scheduling problems in manufacturing, services, and other environments. Michael L. Pinedo is the Julius Schlesinger Professor of Operations Management in the Stern School of Business at New York University. Reviews of third edition: This well-established text covers both the theory and practice of scheduling. he book begins with motivating examples and the penultimate chapter Reviews of third edition: This well-established text covers both the theory and practice of scheduling. The book begins with motivating examples and the penultimate chapter discusses some commercial scheduling systems and examples of their implementations.\" (Mathematical Reviews, 2009)."
