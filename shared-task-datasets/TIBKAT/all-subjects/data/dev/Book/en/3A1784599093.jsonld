            "abstract": "\"This book examines the role that bioremediation can play in the detoxification of soil, water and air to improve environmental and human health, with a specific focus on heavy metals and radionuclides. Environmental pollution, whether by natural or human causes, with industrial activities being a key player, is a challenge facing all nations across the world. While treatment has typically required the use of expensive technology, one promising solution is the use of phytoremediation, in which plants act by metabolising or sequestering pollutants. This eco-friendly solution is a good alternative to the standard methods of soil and water treatments. This book provides not only the basic definitions and classification of technologies used for contaminant remediation but also the most recent studies dealing with the selection of new promising microbial stains and plant varieties involved in the treatment of radioactive and heavy metals contaminants. It provides a detailed description of the biochemical mechanisms and genes involved in the bioremediation of radionuclides and heavy metals, offering a clear insight for academics and practitioners interested in in vitro and in situ biological treatment. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in environmental pollution and environmental health from across a range of different disciplines, including environmental microbiology and chemistry, ecology and environmental science, biological and environmental engineering and biotechnology\"--",
