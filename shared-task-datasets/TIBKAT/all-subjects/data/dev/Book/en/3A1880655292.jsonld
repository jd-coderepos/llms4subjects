Physical applications are used to develop the techniques and demonstrate their wide-ranging applicability. Formalism is introduced sparingly and step-by-step, where it is needed, and chapters contain exercises for readers to test their understanding. Worked solutions to the exercises are included. It is an ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate or postgraduate courses on mathematical methods for physicists, for students whose background is in physics rather than mathematics. It is assumed that the reader has no prior knowledge of mathematical methods beyond the content of a standard undergraduate physics degree. The purpose of the book is to act as a 'gateway' to more advanced books on the applications of differential geometry in physics. It will also help the reader to better appreciate modern physics research that makes use of differential geometry, and the common features that permeate the discipline as a whole\"--",
