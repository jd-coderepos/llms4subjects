                "The coupled cluster method represents one of the most successful and often used approaches to a quantum-theoretical determination of atomic, molecular, and solid state electronic structure and properties. These methods are relevant to a broad spectrum of disciplines ranging from astrophysics to pharmacology. The knowledge of various chemical and physical properties (such as dipole or quadrupole moments, ionization potentials or electron affinities, excitation energies, polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities, potential energy and property surfaces, etc.) is essential for an understanding of many basic processes and, ultimately, for the development and design of practical devices and techniques based on such phenomena. The key to all such computations is the efficient and size-extensive handling of many-electron correlation effects, which represents a particularly strong aspect of coupled cluster methods. Recent Progress in Coupled Cluster Methods provides an excellent overview of status quo and future trends in coupled cluster methodology which will enable both researchers and students to become acquainted with recent progress in this area of continuing intense activity. Each of the 22 chapters has been prepared by eminent practitioners in this field of endeavor and emphasizes the fundamental aspects as well as related methodology. This volume provides a useful source of reference for both researchers in chemistry, molecular physics and molecular biology and practitioners working in these fields. It is also recommendable to people using related software packages.",
