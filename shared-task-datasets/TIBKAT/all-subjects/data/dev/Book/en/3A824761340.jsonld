Filled with full-colour, illustrated interviews and case studies, Bossom and Dunning give insights into the creative processes involved in making games, the global business behind the big budget productions, console and online markets, as well as web and app gaming and the (re)emergence of the indie game scene. The Game Business is a visually engaging, easy to navigate resource providing discussion points, practical exercises and inspiring examples. It takes an enthusiastic and critical approach to the subject matter supported by insight from professionals working within and across various game industry formats, leaving the reader primed for their first steps in the industry. The breadth of topics covered in this book will stand out from other game industry titles for its inclusiveness; giving a truly unique overview of what has become a diverse business. With an eye on the changing nature of publishing The Game Business is supported by web-based resources, providing walk-through tutorials, additional exercises, interactive examples, exemplar work and extended interviews. Finally, both in print and online, the authors have selected links to relevant content, such as TED talks, studio addresses and other websites/blogs to help place the book in the wider games' industry community\"--",
