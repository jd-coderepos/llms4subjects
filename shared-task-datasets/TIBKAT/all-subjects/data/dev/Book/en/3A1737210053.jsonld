            "abstract": "\"This volume explores and explains the vast uses and benefits of algae as food, feed, and fuel. It covers the most advanced applications of algae in the food and feed industries and for environmental sustainability. With chapters written by experts and which were extensively reviewed by many well-known subject experts and professionals, Phycobiotechnology: Biodiversity and Biotechnology of Algae and Algal Products for Food, Feed, and Fuel provides an abundance of valuable information. Algae are a genetically diverse group of organisms with a wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics that have unique capabilities in the fields of agriculture, pharmaceuticals, industry, and environment. Algae hold the potential to become the planet's next major source of energy and a vital part of the solution for climate change and dependence on fossil fuels. Many varieties of algae are also known to be an abundant source of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that can boost the human immune system. The algal industry is a booming sector and will continue to grow, and the editors state, it would not be wrong to call algae the most potent organism of the century due to its many applications and economic value. Key features of the book: Looks at the diversity and distribution of common seaweeds and microalgal biomarkers for hydrocarbon exploration Reviews microalgal bioactive compounds, biomolecules, and biofuels for sustainable development Discusses the health benefits of fucoidan (found in many species of brown seaweed) and the role of cyanobacteria against various human diseases Provides an evaluation of protocols for biomass recovery and lipid extraction by microalgae Defines DNA rearrangements in cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation Presents systematic insights into the biotechnological applications of microalgae and exploitation of omega-3 fatty acids Explores genetic engineering tools and metabolic engineering aspects of algae This volume will be a rich and welcome reference for academicians, researchers, industry professionals, and postgraduate students in the fields of phycology, ecology, environmental biology, botany, microbiology, and biotechnology\"--",
