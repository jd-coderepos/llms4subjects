            "abstract": "\"In the last ten years concepts such as urban health and liveability have become ever more present in urban planning studies. Many companies rank the most liveable city in the world or in a nation and many indicators try to measure factors which can report the health of a place by investigating it in different ways. If, from a part, the liveability and health concepts are more and more explored in urban studies, on the other, due to the strong contamination coming from other disciplines, it is possible to understand why a place is liveable, but it is difficult to design a place being sure that this will be healthy and liveable. Accordingly, aim of this book is, after the definition of the field of investigation concerning sustainable regeneration trough topics such as resilience, adaptation, health and mixed connections, to illustrate the present-day approaches to the analysis and design of healthy places, and in particular the original Healthy Pl@ce Design method, flexible and repeatable in different contexts. The method aims at: identifying sustainable urban liveability and healthy and the factors which make places liveable and healthy from the user's point of view and identifying design interventions to enhance or create both urban liveability and health. Emblematic case studies carried out in Europe, USA and China - Bordeaux, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Madrid, Newcastle, Nice, Dublin, Vancouver and Wuhan - constitute the empirical part of the Book detailed with surveys, questionnaires, images and maps. The theoretical framework - built on contemporary issues - and international case studies make this book both attractive and scientific adding a new stone on the sustainable city construction and opening it to a particularly wide readership, including scholars, students, administrators, and professionals\"--",
