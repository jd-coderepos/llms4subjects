Biotechnology of Plant Secondary Metabolism: Methods and Protocols explores different secondary metabolite classes, whole-plant and cell/organ culture systems, and environmental and genetic transformation-based modulation of biochemical pathways. Special focus is given to cell and tissue specific metabolism, metabolite transport, microRNA-based technology, heterologous systems expression of enzymes and pathways leading to products of interest, as well as applications using both model and non-model plant species. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Practical and cutting-edge, Biotechnology of Plant Secondary Metabolism: Methods and Protocols is a great resource for scientists of interdisciplinary fields--plant science, plant physiology, pharmacy, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioengineering, and forestry--in reaching their goals of producing plant biochemicals in a sustainable and efficient manner, while minimizing impacts to the environment and providing the required quantities of these commodities to industry",
