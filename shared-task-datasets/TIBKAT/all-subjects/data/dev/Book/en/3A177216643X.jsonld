                "\"This book explores how climate institutions in industrialised countries work to further recognition of social differences and integrate this understanding in climate policy making. With contributions from a range of expert scholars in the field, this volume investigates policy making in climate institutions from the perspective of power related to gender. It also considers other intersecting social factors at different levels of governance, from the global to the local level extending into climate relevant sectors. The authors argue that a focus on climate institutions is important since they not only develop strategies and policies, they also (re)produce power relations, promote specific norms and values, and distribute resources. The chapters throughout draw on examples from various institutions including national ministries, transport and waste management authorities, local authorities as well as the European Union and the UNFCCC regime. Overall, the book demonstrates how feminist institutionalist theory and intersectionality approaches can contribute to an increased understanding about power relations and social differences in climate policy-making and in climate relevant sectors in industrialised states. In doing so, it highlights the challenges of path dependencies, but also reveals opportunities for advancing gender equality, equity and social justice. Gender, Intersectionality and Climate Institutions in Industrialized States will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate politics, international relations, gender studies and policy studies\"--",
