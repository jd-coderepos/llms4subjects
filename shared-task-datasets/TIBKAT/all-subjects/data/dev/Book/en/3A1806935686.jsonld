Beyond traditional boundaries of urbanism, it voyages by streets, cities, and planetary ecosystems, enhancing synergies between urban disciplines, evolving new approaches to preserve well-being, amplifying opportunities for a healthy and equitable life on a sustainable planet.\u201d \u2014Professor Waleska Teixeira Caiaffa, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil \u201cThis book is an indispensable read for all those concerned about how urban development can support a growing world population, providing equitable opportunities for healthy living within planetary boundaries.\u201d \u2014Professor Sir Andrew Haines, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK \u201cPineo\u2019s examination of healthy urbanism offers a deep dive and a systems thinking framework to understanding the social and physical determinants of health. The site-specific examples and case studies bring the research to life and make this text very readable for people in and outside of public health and urban design disciplines.\u201d \u2014Sharon Z. Roerty, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, USA The globally distributed health impacts of environmental degradation and widening inequalities require a fundamental shift in understandings of healthy urbanism. This book redefines the meaning and form of healthy urban environments, urging planners and design professionals to consider how their work impacts population health and wellbeing at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The concepts of equity, inclusion and sustainability are central to this framing, reversing the traditional focus on individuals, their genes and \u2018lifestyle choices\u2019 to one of structural factors that affect health. Integrating theory and concepts from social epidemiology, sustainable development and systems thinking with practical case studies, this book will be of value for students and practitioners.
