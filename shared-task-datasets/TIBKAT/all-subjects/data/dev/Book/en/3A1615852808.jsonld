This is provided by Acoustics and Aerodynamic Sound, which serves as a short, one semester introduction to acoustics and aerodynamic sound at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. Sound is treated as a branch of fluid mechanics, which is possible because students embarking on an advanced course in acoustics will be familiar with this topic.
