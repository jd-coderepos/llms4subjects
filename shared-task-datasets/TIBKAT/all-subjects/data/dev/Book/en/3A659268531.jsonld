Furthermore, not only does it explain how the technologies work, but it also discusses what makes each of them significant, such as the potential for finding new meaning in data in the world of BIG DATA platforms, often referred to as \"No-SQL\" databases. In addition, it tackles the newest areas of technology such as web and mobile 2.0, open source, mash-ups, cloud computing, web 3.0, augmented reality, and more. Finally, the book makes sense of the opportunities and challenges of a connected world where both machines and people communicate in a pervasive fashion, looking beyond the hype and promise of emerging categories of communication such as the \"Internet of things\" and \"connected devices\" to show managers how to understand the potential of the enabling technologies and apply them for meaningful applications in their own world.\u02ba Explores the common underlying technological themes that underpin the new era of connected services\u02ba Addresses the newest areas of technology such as web and mobile 2.0, open source, mash-ups, cloud computing, web 3.0, augmented reality, and more\u02ba Shows the reader how to understand the potential of the enabling technologies and apply them for meaningful applications in their own world\u02ba Discusses new developments in the technological landscape such as Smartphone proliferation, maturation of Web 2.0, increased convergence between mobile networks and the Internet, and so forth\"--",
