                "This book explores vegetable fiber composite as an eco-friendly, biodegradable, and sustainable material that has many potential industrial applications. The use of vegetable fiber composite supports the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to utilize more sustainable and greener composite materials, which are also easy to handle and locally easily available with economical production costs. This book presents various types of vegetable fiber composite and its processing methods and treatments to obtain desirable properties for certain applications. The book caters to researchers and students who are working in the field of bio-composites and green materials.",
