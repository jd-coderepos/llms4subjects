            "abstract": "\"As the world's most popular beverage, tea has fascinated us, awakened us, motivated us, and calmed us for well over two thousand years. A History of Tea tells the compelling story of the rise of tea in Asia and its eventual spread to the West and beyond. From the tea houses of China's ancient Tang Dynasty (618-907) to the tea ceremonies developed by Japanese Zen Buddhist monks, to the current social issues faced by tea growers in India and Sri Lanka- this fascinating book explores the complex history of this universal drink. It illuminates the industries and traditions that have developed as tea spread throughout the world and it explains how tea is transformed into the many varieties that people drink each day. It also features a quick reference guide on subjects such as proper tea terminology and brewing. Whatever your cup of tea, green, black, white, oolong, chai, Japanese, Chinese, Sri Lankan, American or British, every tea aficionado will enjoy reading A History of Tea to learn more about their favorite beverage.\"--",
