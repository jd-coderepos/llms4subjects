            "title": "Handbook on european non-discrimination law",
            "abstract": "This handbook provides an overview of key aspects of non-discrimination law in Europe, with specific reference to the prohibition of discrimination provided in the Council of Europe\u2019s European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and the law of the European Union, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The handbook acknowledges that the principle of non-discrimination is very important because it influences the enjoyment of all other human rights. The aim of non-discrimination law is to allow all individuals an equal and fair prospect to access opportunities available in a society. The handbook is designed to assist legal practitioners who are not specialised in the field of non-discrimination law, serving as an introduction to key issues involved. It is intended for lawyers, judges, prosecutors, social workers, as well as for persons who work with national authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other bodies that deal with legal questions relating to issues of discrimination. The handbook may also be useful for legal research or public advocacy purposes. It is designed to permit practitioners to refer directly to specific sections/topics as required; it is not necessary to read the handbook as a whole. European non-discrimination law, as constituted in particular by the EU non-discrimination directives, and Article 14 of and Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights, prohibits discrimination across a range of contexts and grounds. This handbook examines European nondiscrimination law stemming from these two sources as complementary systems, drawing on them interchangeably to the extent that they overlap, while highlighting differences where these exist. It also contains references to other Council of Europe instruments, in particular the European Social Charter, as well as to relevant United Nations instruments. With the impressive body of case law by the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union in the non-discrimination field, it seems useful to present, in an accessible way, a handbook intended for legal practitioners \u2013 such as judges, prosecutors and lawyers, as well as lawenforcement officers \u2013 in the EU and Council of Europe member states and beyond.",
