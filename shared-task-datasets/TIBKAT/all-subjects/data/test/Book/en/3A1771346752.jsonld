            "abstract": "\"Waste can be defined as something no longer wanted, something destroyed, broken, or damaged beyond repair and therefore disposed of or simply thrown away because it is no longer functional, needed, or wanted. However, the focus of this book turns to the question: is waste always really a waste? Stated differently, waste is not a waste if it can be recycled in some form or the other. This book examines all types of waste and their impacts, and discusses the potential ways to mitigate them through recycling and reuse strategies. Features: Addresses agricultural, biomedical, chemical, construction, hazardous, human, municipal solid waste, and more. Explains the fundamentals for waste recycling and reuse. Examines the current state of ocean pollution as well as the latest international regulations. Covers the life cycles of consumer electronic products, and their related metals and minerals, which are increasingly a major source of \"E-Waste\" The Science of Waste is intended to be used by environmental scientists and engineers, public health officials, legal professionals, students, and instructors interested in waste, as well as the management and reuse thereof\"--",
