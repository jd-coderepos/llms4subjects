Important key concepts are discussed on how to provide login credentials with restricted access to third parties with primary account as a resource server. Detailed protocol overview and authorization process along with security analysis of Oauth 2.0 is discussed in this book. This book also includes case studies of websites for vulnerability issues. Features : provides overview of security challenges of IoT and mitigation techniques with a focus on authorization and access control mechanisms, discusses behavioral analysis of threats and attacks using UML base modelling, covers use of Oauth2.0 Protocol and UMA for connecting web applications, includes Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Permission Based Access Control (PBAC). and explores how to provide access to third party web applications through resource server by use of secured and reliable Oauth2.0 framework. This book aims at researchers and professionals in IT Security, Auditing, and Computer Engineering\"--",
