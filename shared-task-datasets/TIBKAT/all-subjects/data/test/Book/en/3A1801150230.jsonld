With this in mind, Mexican architect Juan Carral (born 1976) conceived of Donceles Studios as a multipurpose building representative of the neighborhood's diverse social strata. In this text, Carral further explores the infrastructure of Donceles, noting its rich urban layout and its self-made architectural identity as well as its privileged location and more accessible cost of living. The result is a compelling argument for a new form of experimental real estate development based on participatory strategies and an inclusive ideology. Carral urges his fellow architects to approach real estate development with a wider lens, keeping in mind a long-term vision of the city we want to have",
