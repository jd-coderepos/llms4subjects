                "' ... this book provides a diverse collection of studies focusing on the activities of indigenous peoples, some entrepreneurial in nature and others not. And, as such, policymakers, researchers and students with an interest in these peoples, particularly those in the field of developmental economics, will find it to be a worthwhile reference. It will also provide entrepreneurship scholars and students with important insights as to the role that context and culture play in shaping opportunity identification and barriers to such.' - Rachel Doern, International Small Business Journal. 'This title will provide a lot of new information and intriguing facts for those interested in entrepreneurship in developing countries.' - Shannon Graff Hysell, American Reference Books Annual ' ... a tremendous collection of articles on the issue of indigenous entrepreneurship ... The layout and structure of the book is well refined and I would highly recommend the book to all entrepreneurship scholars, practitioners and the general community as a thoroughly researched and useful reference ... This book is definitely a great addition to the indigenous entrepreneurship field and will remain a cornerstone of indigenous entrepreneurship studies for many years to come.' - Vanessa Ratten, Journal of Enterprising Communities. 'This book offers an original collection of international studies on indigenous entrepreneurship. Through these specific lenses, entrepreneurship greatly appears as a set of cultural values-based behaviours. Once more culture and human values are placed at the heart of entrepreneurship as an economic and social phenomenon.' - Alain Fayolle, EM Lyon and CERAG Laboratory, France and Solvay Business School, Belgium. 'A must-have for researchers of developmental economics, as well as for entrepreneurship scholars, this collection assembles studies of indigenous entrepreneurship from five continents. To add value, the editors analyse the contributions and identify common themes, thus laying the framework for a comprehensive theory on indigenous entrepreneurship. Dana and Anderson demonstrate that entrepreneurship is not simply a function of opportunity, but rather opportunity recognition is a function of cultural values. For this reason, mainstream theories do not suffice to explain entrepreneurship in indigenous communities. Illustrated with breathtaking photographs, this volume is also reader-friendly for the non-academic.' - Richard W. Wright, UCLA Anderson Schoo ...",
