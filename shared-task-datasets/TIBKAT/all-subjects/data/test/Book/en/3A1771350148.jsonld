            "abstract": "\"This book examines and explains material from the 9th edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, including deck and parapet design, load calculations, limit states and load combinations, concrete and steel I-girder design, bearing design, and more. With increased focus on earthquake resiliency, two separate chapters- one on conventional seismic design and the other on seismic isolation applied to bridges- will fully address this vital topic. The primary focus is on steel and concrete I-girder bridges, with regard to both superstructure and substructure design. Features: Includes several worked examples for a project bridge as well as actual bridges designed by the author Examines seismic design concepts and design details for bridges Presents the latest material based on the 9th edition of the LRFD Bridge Design Specifications Covers fatigue, strength, service, and extreme event limit states Includes numerous solved problems and exercises at the end of each chapter to illustrate the concepts presented LRFD Bridge Design: Fundamentals and Applications will serve as a useful text for graduate and upper-level undergraduate civil engineering students as well as practicing structural engineers\"--",
