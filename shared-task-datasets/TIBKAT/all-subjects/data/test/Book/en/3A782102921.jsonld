                "Fundamentals of Air Pollution is an important and widely used textbook in the environmental science and engineering community. This thoroughly revised fifth edition of Fundamentals of Air Pollution has been updated throughout and remains the most complete text available, offering a stronger systems perspective and more coverage of international issues relating to air pollution. Sections on pollution control have been reorganized and updated to demonstrate the move from regulation and control approaches to green and sustainable engineering approaches.    The fifth edition maintains a strong interdisciplinary approach to the study of air pollution, covering such topics as chemistry, physics, meteorology, engineering, toxicology, policy, and regulation. New material includes near-road air pollution, new risk assessment approaches, indoor air quality, the impact of biofuels and fuel additives, mercury emissions, forecasting techniques, and the most recent results from the National Air Toxics Assessment",
                "\"Air pollution is a very complex societal problem. It has been recognized as such for centuries. Unlike many scientific phenomena, its cause and effect relationships have been reasonably deductive. For example, in the 14th century, King Edward II decreed that the cause of London's air pollution problem was attributed to burning coal, and incidentally, anyone found burning coal while Parliament was meeting would be executed. That is a supreme example of a science-based decision followed by strong execution; literally!\"--"
