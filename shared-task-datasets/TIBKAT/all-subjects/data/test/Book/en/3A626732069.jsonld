                "Domestic space and social organisation -- House-form and social complexity : the transformation of early Iron Age Greece -- A space for \"hurling the furniture\" : the architecture and the development of Greek domestic symposia -- Housing and cultural identity : Delos, between Greece and Rome -- Seeing the domus behind the dominus in Roman Pompeii : artefact distributions as evidence for the whole household -- Housing as symbol : elite self-preservation in North Africa under Roman rule -- Epilogue: Domestic space and social organisation in classical antiquity -- Glossary -- Period names and dates referred to in this book",
                "\"Housing is shaped by culturally-specific expectations about the kinds of architecture and furnishings that are appropriate; about how and where different activities should be carried out; and by and with whom. It is those expectations, and the wider social and cultural systems of which they are a part, that are explored in this volume. At the same time, the book as a whole argues two larger points: first, that while houses, households, and families have in recent years become increasingly important as objects of inquiry in Greek and Roman contexts, their potential as sources of information about broader social-historical issues has yet to be fully realised; and second, that greater weight and independence should be given to material culture as a source for studying ancient history. The book will be invaluable for upper-level undergraduates, graduate students, and scholars\"--Provided by publisher"
