            "abstract": "This book presents state-of-the-art environmental remediation processes. Environmental protection and management is a global concern, especially in the context of industrial regions. Over the years, several conventional, engineering-based physicochemical decontamination methods have used in the remediation of polluted sites. However, these methods are expensive and have limited efficiency. Drawing on research and examples from around the world, this book offers a comprehensive review of and insights into green technologies and sustainable remediation alternatives. It discusses the emerging importance of nanotechnology, chemo and biosensors, indicator species, microbe-based remediation of organic compounds, and ex-situ remediation methods. Addressing the growing global need for a holistic overview of the environmental remediation of polluted sites, it will appeal to teachers, researchers, scientists, capacity builders, and policymakers. It also serves as additional reading material for undergraduate and graduate students of biotechnology and environmental sciences.",
