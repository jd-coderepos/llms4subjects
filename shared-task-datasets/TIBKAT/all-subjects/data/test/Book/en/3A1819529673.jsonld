            "abstract": "An English translation of the surviving astrological works of the 2nd century astrologer Vettius Valens, along with a detailed overview of his life and works, by classics professor Mark T. Riley. Valens' \"Anthology\" is a collection of instructional texts on astrology that he wrote for his students in Greek. It is perhaps the single most important surviving source for understanding what the practice of astrology was like in ancient times, because Valens included more than a hundred examples in order to demonstrate how birth charts were interpreted in antiquity. Valens lived in the Roman Empire during the reigns of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. He wrote in Greek because that was the common language that was used for scientific and philosophical works in the Mediterranean region during that time. Valens' work became popular later during the medieval period with astrologers who wrote in Greek and Arabic, however he was largely forgotten in the subsequent eras, until recently. This publication marks the first time that the entirety of the \"Anthology\" has ever been translated into English.--Publisher",
