                "'Entrepreneurship provides a deep insight into the complex world of international new ventures in different cultural and institutional settings. Having conducted most of my research and teaching in this field, I am impressed by the quality and depth of this book. It is not only interesting from an academic perspective but also from a practitioner perspective as well. This book explains and synthesizes the most relevant topics that every person involved in international business and entrepreneurship should take into consideration.' - Christian Keen, VP Global Commerce Strategy, Stratekey Canal.

The editors and contributors to this volume show how conventional theories of entrepreneurship and business do not fully address the challenges inherent in achieving and sustaining global competitiveness. Over the course of 11 research-based chapters, they detail rich frameworks and fresh solutions for navigating the complex and quickly evolving global business environment, providing insight into a number of current international entrepreneurship issues. These include high-growth and rapid internationalization, managerial leadership, born globals, the impact of networks, inter-organizational ties and knowledge intens ...",
