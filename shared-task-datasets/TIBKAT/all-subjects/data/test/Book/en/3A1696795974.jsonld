            "abstract": "\"This book describes all aspects of how deep excavations in soil are created that are essential for constructing underground metro systems and deep basements in urban areas. A comprehensive description of the activities is given from initial planning, through the stages of design and construction, and ending with resolution of any contractual disputes. Examples are cited from completed projects spanning 50 years and, for inquiring minds, there are many references for further insight. Written in plain English, readers will appreciate how these modern engineering marvels are created and gain insight into the entire inter-related engineering activities that are involved. It also serves to inform advanced students and practicing engineers about everything that they may come across and need to know about deep excavations including lessons to be learned from many years of experience\"--",
