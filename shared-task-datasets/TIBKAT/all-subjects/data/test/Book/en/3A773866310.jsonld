            "title": "Urban theory and the urban experience : encountering the city",
            "abstract": "\"Since publication of the first edition in 2004, the balance has shifted with the majority of the world's population now living in an urban setting. Urban Theory and the Urban Experience once again brings together classic and contemporary approaches to urban research in order to reveal the intellectual origins of urban studies and the often unacknowledged debt that empirical and theoretical perspectives on the city owe one another. Completely revised and updated, and with new chapters on the Majority Urban World and the Global South, Cities under Stress and the Information City, the second edition of Urban Theory and the Urban Experience traces the key developments in the idea of the city over more than a century; from Weber, Simmel, Benjamin and Lefebbvre to more contemporary urban theorists David Harvey and Manuel Castells. The volume also considers the impact of new information and communication technologies, and the growing trend towards disaggregated urban networks, all of which raise important questions about viability and physical and social identity of the conventional townscape. This book is an ideal text for students on Geography, Urban Studies, Sociology, Planning and Built Environment courses, but the accessibility and breadth mean that it will also appeal to practitioners and all those that wish to learn more about why the urban has become the dominant social, economic and cultural form of the twenty-first century\"--",
