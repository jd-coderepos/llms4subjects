            "abstract": "This book highlights the prevention of possible accidents and crashes of aircrafts by analyzing the many factors that affect such events. It includes the theoretical study of known ideas and concepts, as well as a set of new methods and mathematical models. It contains factual information to investigate famous disasters and aviation accidents with aircrafts. The book proposes methods and models that can be the basis in developing guidance material for decision-making by the flight crew and experts in air traffic control. Some of the contents presented in this book are also useful in the design and operation of data transmission systems of aircraft. The book is intended for engineering and technical specialists engaged in the development, manufacturing and operations of onboard radio electronic systems of aircraft and ground-based radio engineering support for flights, as well as graduate students and senior students of radio engineering specialties. It is useful to researchers and managers whose activities are related to air traffic control",
