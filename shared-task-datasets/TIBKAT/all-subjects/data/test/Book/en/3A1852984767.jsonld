            "abstract": "\"There has been considerable attention to making the methodologies of structural equation modeling available to researchers, practitioners, and students along with commonly used software. Structural Equation Modelling Using R/SAS aims to bring it all together to provide a concise point-of-reference for the most commonly used structural equation modeling from the fundamental level to the advanced level. This book is intended to contribute to the rapid development in structural equation modeling and its applications to real-world data. Straightforward explanations of the statistical theory and models related to structural equation models are provided, using a compilation of a variety of publicly available data, to provide an illustration of data analytics in a step-by-step fashion using commonly used statistical software of R and SAS. This book is appropriate for anyone who is interested in learning and practicing structural equation modeling, especially in using R and SAS. It is useful for applied statisticians, data scientists and practitioners, applied statistical analysts and scientists in public health, and academic researchers and graduate students in statistics, whilst also being of use to R&D professionals/practitioners in industry and governmental agencies\"--",
