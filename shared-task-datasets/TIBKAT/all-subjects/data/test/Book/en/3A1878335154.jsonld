                "This book covers latest information on organic and inorganic waste management, and how the waste can be utilized as an energy source. An increasing world population and climate change rate hint that environmental health needs a sustainable waste recycling system worldwide. Management of wastes material plays a substantial role in the environment and climate regulation. Chapters contain modern tools and techniques for managing inorganic, biomedical, municipality, and food waste. The title covers the role of contemporary microbiology and biotechnological tools in waste management and how these microbial agents can enhance waste degradation and bioenergy production. The book covers interesting topics such as bio-ethanol production from agro-waste, microbial fuel cells, biogas production from animal waste, nanotechnology in waste recycling, etc. The primary audiences are researchers, scientists, students, and policymakers interlinked with waste management and applied microbial sectors."
