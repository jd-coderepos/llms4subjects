            "abstract": "\"Cybernetics is a field of study concerned with the understanding of control and communication systems in both natural and artificial systems. It deals with the study of feedback mechanisms, control systems, and information processing, and has had a significant influence on the development of artificial intelligence and computer science. Neural networks, on the other hand, are a type of machine learning algorithm that are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are capable of learning and making predictions or decisions based on input data, and are widely used in a range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. The combination of cybernetics and neural networks provides a powerful framework for understanding and developing artificial intelligence systems that can perform a wide range of tasks and make decisions based on data. Cybernetical Intelligence provides a comprehensive overview of these technologies, covering their history, mathematical foundations, different types, applications, and challenges, and is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding and working with artificial intelligence and cybernetics\"--",
