            "abstract": "Perhaps the best-known aspect of the behavior of metals, and indeed of most materials, is that they weaken with temperature. This weakening is however a problem in some applications. Only tungsten for instance, with its naturally high melting-point, was suitable for the manufacture of the filaments of incandescent light-bulbs. Even then, it was necessary to add oxide particles having a yethigher melting-point in order to prevent the weakening effect of grain-growth. These are alloys however which can be said to be weakened by heat, but nevertheless \u2018hang on\u2019 to enough strength to perform their task. The real boon would be an alloy which actually, as it were, \u2018rose to the occasion\u2019. Such a class of alloy exists, and is the subject of this book. It brings together everything which is known about the yield strength anomaly; both theoretically and experimentally. Keywords: Mechanical Properties, Materials Processing, Alloy, Materials Survey, Yield stress Most metals, indeed most materials, weaken as they get hotter, says Fisher, but he identifies and describes a class of alloys that does not. They are said to exhibit a yield-point anomaly, or a positive temperature dependence of the tensile strength, he says, and do weakened eventually with increasing temperature, but reach their peak strength at temperatures useful in gas turbines and other applications. He explains that the phenomenon arises from a blocking of the dislocation motions that mediate deformation processes, rather than some anomaly in the elastic modulus or some other intrinsic property. \u2014 Engineering\u2014 Materials science\u2014 Metals",
