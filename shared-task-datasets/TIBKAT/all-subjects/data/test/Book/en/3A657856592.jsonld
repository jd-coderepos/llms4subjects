Computational approaches are needed to solve the complex mathematical equations that typically arise in engineering problems, for correlating experimental data, and for obtaining numerical results that are used for improving existing processes and developing new ones. The second edition follows the basic ideas, discussions, approaches, and presentation employed in the first edition. The focus is clearly on engineering processes and systems and on the equations that characterize and describe these. Computer methods that are employed to solve these equations and the nature and validity of the numerical results obtained are discussed for a variety of problems. The main thrust is on the discussion of the various numerical methods that are available for a given problem, on the presentation of the basic aspects of the methods, discussing their applicability, efficiency and behavior, and then applying these to typical problems chosen from various engineering disciplines\"--",
