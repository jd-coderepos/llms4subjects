            "abstract": "The human ability to understand and produce spoken words is fascinating in its complexity. People often vary in how they pronounce a word. They may need to recognize words spoken with an accent quite different from their own. And, in order to understand a word of a second or foreign language, they may need to identify words on the basis of sounds that are difficult to differentiate. This book brings together psycholinguistic research that addresses these topics and highlights how the study of spoken word processing can shed light on fundamental dynamics of language processing. It demonstrates how spoken word processing is affected by the specific characteristics of individual languages and their writing systems and how it grows and changes across the lifespan. The book offers new cutting-edge research on spoken word processing. It will benefit researchers and students interested in language processing as well as readers who wish to broaden their understanding of language in the mind. In particular, this book underlines the value of conducting psycholinguistic research across languages and across the lifespan. Originally published in The Mental Lexicon Vol. 8:3 (2013).",
