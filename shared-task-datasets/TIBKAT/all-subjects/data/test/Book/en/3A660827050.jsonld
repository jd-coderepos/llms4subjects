            "abstract": "Religiously influenced, often violent confrontations shape the image of our days - and rising. Terrorism, persecution of religious minorities, disputes over religious symbols and ritual practice as headscarves, full-body veiling, crosses and mosques - the list could go on and almost any are social top subjects. Dramatic conflicts after BlasphemieVorw\u00fcrfen, or the violation of religious feelings in the name of artistic freedom and government recognition of certain religious positions as a religion to show how pervasive the problem is in our time. The human right to religious freedom is discussed in the light of religious tolerance and mutual respect, with sensitive issues - such as the mission - are not to be missed. It takes an emphatic plea for religious freedom - for the sake of a free society, and because of the freedom of faith! How religious actors behave itself on freedom of religion, and what they themselves can do to protect and strengthen its worth? This book is written from the perspective of Catholic theology, it puts the emphasis on the position of the Catholic Church and its role in contemporary religious-political conflicts. Using concrete examples, it discusses what is important and when religious freedom is to be respected as a human right and protected",
