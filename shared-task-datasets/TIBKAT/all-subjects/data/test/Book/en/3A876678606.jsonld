                "Advanced Electronic Packaging, Second Edition reflects the changes in the electronic packaging industry, as well as feedback from students, engineers, and educators since the publication of the First Edition in 1999. Like the First Edition, each chapter is authored by one or more acknowledged experts and then carefully edited to ensure a consistent level of quality and approach throughout.Readers familiar with the First Edition will note several key changes. For example, organic and ceramic substrates are now covered in separate chapters. There are new chapters on passive devices, RF and microwave packaging, electronic package assembly, and cost evaluation and assembly. In addition, readers have access to the latest information and findings in such topics as:. Packaging materials and applications. Modeling and simulations. Analytical techniques for materials. MEMS packaging. Fabrication technologies and package design. Reliability. Electrical, mechanical, and thermal considerations. Three-dimensional packagingAll the hallmarks of the First Edition, which became an industry standard and a popular graduate-level textbook, have been retained. Examples illustrate real-world applications, which are then reinforced by the extensive use of exercises to enable readers themselves to place their newfound knowledge into practice. In addition, references are provided that guide readers to more in-depth information and primary resources in specialized topics.Fully updated, this comprehensive reference remains the preeminent graduate-level textbook in its field as well as an essential reference for engineers and scientists",
