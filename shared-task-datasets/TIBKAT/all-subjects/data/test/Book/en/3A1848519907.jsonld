            "abstract": "Fuzzy logic has vast applications in power and electrical engineering. This collection is the first book to cover research advancements in the application of fuzzy logic in the planning and operation of smart grids. A global group of researchers and scholars present innovative approaches to fuzzy-based smart grid planning and operation, cover theoretical concepts and experimental results of the application of fuzzy-based techniques, and define and apply these techniques to deal with smart grid issues. Applications of Fuzzy Logic in Planning and Operation of Smart Grids is an ideal resource for researchers on the theory and application of fuzzy logic, practicing engineers working in electrical power engineering and power system planning, and post-graduates and students in advanced graduate-level courses. The first book to cover fuzzy logic in planning and operation of smart grids; Defines and applies fuzzy-based techniques; Covers theoretical concepts and applications.",
