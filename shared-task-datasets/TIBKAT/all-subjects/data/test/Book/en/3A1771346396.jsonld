                "\"A Prelude to Quantum Field Theory offers a short introduction to quantum field theory (QFT), a powerful framework for understanding particle behavior that is an essential tool across many subfields of physics. A subject that is typically taught at the graduate level in most physics departments, quantum field theory is a unification of standard quantum theories and special relativity, which depicts all particles as \"excitations\" that arise in underlying fields. It extends quantum mechanics, the modern theory of one or few particles, in a way that is useful for the analysis of many-particle systems in the real world. As it requires a different style of thinking from quantum mechanics, which is typically the undergraduate physics student's first encounter with the quantum world, many beginners struggle with the transition to quantum field theory, especially when working with traditional textbooks. Existing books on the subject often tend to be large, sophisticated, and complete; and an overwhelming wealth of information and technical detail makes it difficult for the novice to discern what is most important. This book is a concise, friendly entr\u00e9e for QFT-beginners, guiding the reader from the style of quantum mechanical thinking to that of QFT, and distilling the key ideas without a welter of unnecessary detail. In contrast with standard texts, which are predominantly particle physics-centric, this book is designed to be \"subfield-neutral\" - usable by students of any background and interest, and easily adaptable in a course setting according to instructors' preferences. The authors' conviction is that QFT is a core element of physics that should be understood by all PhD physicists-but that developing an appreciation for it does not require digesting a large, encyclopedic volume\"--",
                "\"A concise, beginner-friendly introduction to quantum field theoryQuantum field theory is a powerful framework that extends quantum mechanics in ways that are essential in many modern applications. While it is the fundamental formalism for the study of many areas of physics, quantum field theory requires a different way of thinking, and many newcomers to the subject struggle with the transition from quantum mechanics. A Prelude to Quantum Field Theory introduces the key concepts of quantum field theory in a brief and accessible manner while never sacrificing mathematical rigor. The result is an easy-to-use textbook that distills the most general properties of the theory without overwhelming beginning students with more advanced applications.Bridges quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, emphasizing analogies and differencesEmphasizes a \"quantum field theoretical mindset\" while maintaining mathematical rigorObtains quantum fields as the continuum limit of a quantized system of many particlesHighlights the correspondence between wave function-fundamental in quantum mechanics-and the formalism of second quantization used in quantum field theoryProvides a step-by-step derivation of Feynman rules for the perturbative study of interacting theoriesIntroduces students to renormalization, path integrals techniques, and moreDiscusses more modern topics like effective field theoriesIdeal for both undergraduate and graduate studentsProven in the classroom\"--"
