This fundamental limitation, along with atmospheric conditions and interference have long been drivers of intense research and development in the fields of signal processing and filter networks, the two technologies that govern the information capacity of a given frequency spectrum. Written by distinguished experts with a combined century of industrial and academic experience in the field, Microwave Filters for Communication Systems:   Provides a coherent, accessible description of system requirements and constraints for microwave filters  Covers fundamental considerations in the theory and design of microwave filters and the use of EM techniques to analyze and optimize filter structures  Chapters on Multiband Filters and Tunable Filters address the new markets emerging for wireless communication systems and flexible satellite payloads and  A chapter devoted to real-world examples and exercises that allow readers to test and fine-tune their grasp of the material covered in various chapters, in effect it provides the roadmap to develop a software laboratory, to analyze, design, and perform system level tradeoffs including EM based tolerance and sensitivity analysis for microwave filters and multiplexers for practical applications.  Microwave Filters for Communication Systems provides students and practitioners alike with a solid grounding in the theoretical underpinnings of practical microwave filter and its physical realization using state-of-the-art EM-based techniques\"--",
