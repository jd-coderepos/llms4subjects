The book covers the most recent developments detailing all aspects of synthesis, characterization, and performance.It offers an overview on the principles, classifications, and types of fuels used in fuel cells, and discusses the critical properties, design, and advances made in various sealing materials. It provides an extensive review on the design, configuration, fabrication, modeling, materials, and stack performance of [mu]-SOFC technology, and addresses the advancement and challenges in the synthesis, characterization, and fundamental understanding of the catalytic activity of nitrogen-carbon, carbon, and noncarbon-based electro catalysts for PEM fuel cells. The authors explore the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, summarize the advancements in the fundamental understanding of the most successful Nafion membranes, and focus on the development of alternative and composite membranes for direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). They also review current challenges and consider future development in the industry.Includes 17 chapters, 262 figures, and close to 2000 referencesProvides an extensive review of the carbon, nitrogen-carbon, and noncarbon-based electro catalysts for fuel cellsPresents an update on the latest materials development in conventional fuel cells and emerging fuel cellsThis text is a single-source reference on the latest advances in the nano-structured materials and electro catalysts for fuel cells, the most efficient and emerging energy conversion technologies for the twenty-first century. It serves as a valuable resource for students, materials engineers, and researchers interested in fuel cell technology\"--",
