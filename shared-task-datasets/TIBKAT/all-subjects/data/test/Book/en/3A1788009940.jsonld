            "abstract": "This book focuses on the survey technology, post-processing technology, mapping technology and scientific application of the submarine topography and geomorphology in detail. High-resolution submarine geomorphology is a frontier branch of Marine Geology and marine surveying and mapping, which provides a direct basis to study the seabed surface, to understand the tectonic movement and submarine evolution. In the past two decades, high-resolution submarine geomorphology with high-precision multi-beam echo sounding, side-scan sonar and shallow bottom profile as the major techniques, is developing very quickly and is one of the frontiers of international marine science and technology. These high techniques promote the traditional submarine geomorphology to high-resolution and quantitative research. At present, high-resolution submarine geomorphology is widely used in the delimitation of the continental shelf and the international seabed resources survey, marine engineering and marine military applications. In order to facilitate readers to understand how to acquire and apply scientific research based on landform data, it highlights the combination of theory, technology and scientific application. This book is useful as a reference for professional and technical personnel in related fields and also as a textbook for both graduate and undergraduate students as well.",
