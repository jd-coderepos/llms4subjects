                "Why do we trust some brands more than others? How important is integrity for a brand's survival? How can brand confidence be rebuilt during a crisis? Using both new and classic insights from social psychology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience, Brand Psychology reveals the hidden processes behind why certain brands command our loyalty, trust and - most importantly - disposable income. Reputation management authority Jonathan Gabay takes readers on a tour of the corporate, political, and personal brands whose understanding of consumer psychology has either built or broken them. Suitable for marketing, branding and PR professionals, reputation management specialists and students, Brand Psychology takes examples from e-cigarette legislation, the iPhone 5S's fingerprint ID technology, Barclays' branded bikes and the London 2012 Olympics, Miley Cyrus and the UK National Health Service's big data to reveal how to build a meaningful brand that resonates with the public.",
