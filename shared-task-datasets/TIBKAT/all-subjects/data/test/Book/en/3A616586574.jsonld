            "abstract": "\"Deforestation and forest degradation are two of the main causes of the progressing loss of terrestrial biodiversity and are continuing at an alarming rate worldwide, especially in tropical countries. The underlying drivers of forest destruction vary from region to region, but can be linked mainly to human activities such as land use pressure and related policies. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) considers protected areas (PA) as a cornerstone in its strategy for reducing the current loss of species and habitats in all types of ecosystems and therefore calls for a global PA network. Recognising the unsatisfactory spatial coverage and degree of effectiveness of existing PA in forests (FPA), the 9th Conference of the Parties to the CBD (COP9) reconfirmed the importance of national and regional FPA networks and the sustainable financing of FPA. Forests require particular attention regarding conservation due to their exceptional biodiversity, large cover area and their role in the adaptation and mitigation of global climate change. The present report has the objective of supporting the implementation of the recent COP9 decision on FPA through scientific analyses and practical policy-advice. Based on the evaluation of existing concepts for the selection, management and financing of FPA, it develops recommendations for the creation of a global FPA network. The character of the proposed network is discussed and suggestions are made for its realisation under the CBD, in particular concerning FPA selection, financing mechanisms and implementation.\"--Publisher's description",
