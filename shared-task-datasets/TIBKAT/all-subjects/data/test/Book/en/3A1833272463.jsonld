                "\"An introductory text on the analysis, control, and estimation of nonlinear systems, appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate studentsThis self-contained and accessible introduction to the concepts and techniques used for nonlinear feedback systems offers a holistic treatment suitable for use in both advanced undergraduate and graduate courses; students need only some familiarity with differential equations and linear algebra to understand the material presented. The text begins with an overview of stability and Lyapunov methods for nonlinear systems, with Lyapunov's second method revisited throughout the book as a connective thread. Other introductory chapters cover linear systems, frequency domain methods, and discrete-time systems. Building on this background material, the book provides a broad introduction to the basic ideas underpinning major themes of research in nonlinear control, including input-to-state stability, sliding mode control, adaptive control, feedback linearization, and robust output regulation. Chapters also cover observer design and estimation for nonlinear systems. The text is notable for its coverage of nonlinear model predictive control and its introduction to the use of linear matrix inequalities and semidefinite programming coupled with their use in modern antiwindup designs. First text on nonlinear control appropriate for undergraduates Suitable both for students preparing for rigorous graduate study and for those entering technical fields outside of academia Unique in its coverage of recent research topics Pedagogical features including extensive chapter summaries, examples, and appendixes with definitions, results, and MATLAB applications\"--",
                "\"This will be the first textbook on nonlinear control at the upper undergraduate level, reflecting the many updates in the field that have occurred since the 1990s. Nonlinear control is a control engineering course usually taught at the graduate level and preceded by a full semester course on nonlinear systems analysis, yet - as the authors of this textbook argue -- these tools and techniques are accessible to an undergraduate audience and practicing engineers, if presented in the right way. This book is class-tested, growing out of a third-year undergraduate course on nonlinear control and estimation for mechatronics, mechanical and electrical engineering, and mathematics students at the University of Newcastle, Australia. It is part of a trend toward reimagining the content of undergraduate control engineering curricula, to render widely-used tools and techniques accessible to students much earlier in their education, opening them up to those who will not go on to the graduate level. This alternative course sequence currently begins with the text Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers by Astr\u00f6m and Murray (PUP 2008); this new project is designed to follow Astr\u00f6m and Murray in the undergraduate sequence, as a second or third year course\"--"
