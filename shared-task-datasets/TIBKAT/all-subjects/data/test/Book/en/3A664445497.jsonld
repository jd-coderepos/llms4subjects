Shedding light on the day-to-day challenges that need to be overcome to ensure success, it details the how-to's of effective implementationncluding what to implement, how to do it, and when to do it. This complete resource includes a detailed model for executing a release management process, as well as numerous templates, diagrams, and role and responsibility charts to help kick start implementation efforts in your organization. Addressing the all-important cultural aspects, it explains how to sell the benefits of release management to all levels of your organization, how to overcome objections, and how to determine organizational readiness. Emphasizing the need to measure performance, it explains how to develop effective performance metrics and supplies many helpful examples of effective productivity measures. When it comes to implementation, what works in one organization doesnt necessarily work in another.
