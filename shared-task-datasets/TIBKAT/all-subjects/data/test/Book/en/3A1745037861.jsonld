            "abstract": "Food powders are an increasingly important aspect of processed food worldwide. Essential factors such as ease of storage and transport and usage convenience have greatly benefited the food industry and promise further advancements in processing techniques. Food powders can be stored for a longer period of time than other food products, making them essential for food supply in many regions of the world. There have been numerous research works on food powders properties and characterization, but there has not been an updated comprehensive review in this field. Food Powders Properties and Characterization is designed as an essential reference for individuals in the food industry and academia seeking a singular source that covers most of the basic aspects of food powders. With chapters focusing on the general properties of food powders, characterization of particle and bulk properties, adhesion and surface properties, this text presents comprehensive and fully up to date coverage of this challenging and important field. .",
