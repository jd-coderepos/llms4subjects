Continuously committed to innovation and research, SOM's latest endeavor is in creating machine learning software to be used with a variety of platforms and enhance the firm's existing technological practices. With the looming threat of climate change, the firm has dedicated high performance design experts in all offices to lead the way in reducing each project's carbon footprint, streamlining adaptive re-use practices, and developing leading energy performance technology to incorporate into each building. A timely update documenting the firm's immense activity, SOM: Architecture of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, 2009-2019 demonstrates why it has come to occupy its unique station in American and international architecture",
