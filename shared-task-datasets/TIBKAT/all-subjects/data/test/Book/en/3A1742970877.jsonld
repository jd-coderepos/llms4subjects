            "abstract": "\"As so much of our human interaction passes through digital channels, it is essential to understand how being online influences how we communicate with others and ourselves. This textbook introduces students to the fundamental concepts, theories, and applications of computer-mediated communication. Building a foundational understanding of CMC theories, such as CFO, SIP, SIDE, and hyperpersonal, Caleb T. Carr introduces as framework students may use to understand human communication across all digital channels-including those that have yet to exist! Computer-Mediated Communication explores how CMC intersects with and affects other communication subdisciplines, including interpersonal, organizational, and intergroup. Contemporary examples illustrate theories and application, but the text is written to allow and encourage students to think about their own media use in a broader and channel-agnostic mindset, applying what they learn beyond just Instagram and Snapchat, to make sense of their modern and digital world. The focus on the theoretical processes that underlay human communication online helps the book remain current with emerging technologies. Theoretical approach is complemented and made accessible with real-world examples, immediate ways to apply knowledge, and a conversational and approachable writing style.\"",
