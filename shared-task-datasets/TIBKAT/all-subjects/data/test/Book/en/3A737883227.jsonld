            "abstract": "As scientist begin to understand the complexity of lipid signaling and its roles in plant biology, there is an increasing interest in their analysis. Due to the low abundancy and transient nature of some of these hydrophobic compounds, this is not always easy. In Plant Lipid Signaling Protocols, expert researchers in the field detail experimental approaches by which plant signaling lipids can be studied. These methods and techniques include analysis of plant signaling lipids, including detailed protocols to detect various relevant compounds by targeted or non-targeted approaches; to assay relevant enzyme activities in biological material or using recombinant enzymes; to test for specific binding of signaling lipids to protein partners; or to visualize signaling lipids or lipid-derived signals in living plant cells. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and key tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and practical, Plant Lipid Signaling Protocols aids plant researchers in the continuing to study the roles of lipid signals",
