                "\"Greek comedy flourished in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, both in and beyond Athens. Aristophanes and Menander are the best-known writers whose work is in part extant, but many other dramatists are known from surviving fragments of their plays. This sophisticated but accessible introduction explores the genre as a whole, integrating literary questions (such as characterisation, dramatic technique or diction) with contextual ones (for example audience response, festival context, interface with ritual or political frames). In addition, it also discusses relevant historical issues (political, socio-economic and legal) as well as the artistic and archaeological evidence. The result provides a unique panorama of this challenging area of Greek literature which will be of help to students at all levels and from a variety of disciplines but will also provide stimulus for further research\"--",
                "\"The only fully intact textual evidence from 5th-century and (very) early 4th-century comedy are the eleven completely preserved comedies by Aristophanes, who was born, in all likelihood, shortly after 450 BCE and died after 388 BCE.1 This is, in fact, not as thin a basis as one might initially think. For not only is the number of completely preserved Aristophanic comedies actually quite high: it amounts, after all, to about a quarter of Aristophanes' total output of around 40 comedies certainly (contrast this with the seven plays we have by Sophocles and the six or seven we have by Aeschylus, both of whom wrote considerably more plays in total than Aristophanes)\"--"
