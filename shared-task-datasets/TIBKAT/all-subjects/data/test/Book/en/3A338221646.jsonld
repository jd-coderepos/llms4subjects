            "abstract": "In the Kiel Discussion Paper 383, Horst Siebert puts up for discussion some considerations on how to reach a higher growth path in the European Union. The paper was prepared for the first meeting of the Group of Economic Analysis of the European Commission of which Horst Siebert is a member.\u00a4 The author starts by saying that the question of when the business cycle upswing in Europe will start is a wrong question. Rather, the question should be how a higher long- run growth path can be reached. Siebert stresses four strategic variables for growth: Technical progress, human capital formation, capital accumulation, and the removal of existing institutional impediments to growth. In his view, Europe should concentrate on creating an environment which is conducive for the growth factors.\u00a4 Within the next five years, the member states of the EU should shift their policy orientation in favor of economic dynamics and growth by relying on competition to enhance dynamic performance. They should establish an innovation- friendly environment, strengthen human capital formation, reduce the size of government, cut subsidies, reduce marginal tax and contribution rates, support wage moderation in countries where unemployment is high, and deregulate the labor market to allow a more decentralized wage formation.\u00a4",
