                "\"Introduction to Solid Modeling Using SolidWorks; 2013 presents \"keystroke-level\" tutorials, providing users new to the SolidWorks; program with all the detail they need to become confident using the software. Topics are illustrated and infused with examples from the real world such as flanges, brackets, helical springs, and more. Additionally, this easy-to-use guide has modular chapters, allowing for flexible organization of a course or self-study.Accessible and updated for the newest version of software, Introduction to Solid Modeling Using SolidWorks; 2013 by Howard and Musto relates solid modeling exercises to engineering concepts in a way that introduces the engineering design process while simultaneously building student proficiency with a state-of-the-art software tool. The Student Design Kit is no longer available as a download. Instructors can receive free 1 year copies of SolidWorks for their students by going to www.solidworks.com/studentaccess. Schools must be on subscription to receive free student software. \"--",
                "\"As design engineers and engineering professors, the authors have witnessed incredible changes in the way that products are designed and manufactured. One of the biggest changes over the past 20 years has been the development and widespread usage of solid modeling software. When we first saw solid modeling, it was used only by large companies. The cost of the software and the powerful computer workstations required to run it, along with the complexity of using the software, limited its use. As the cost of computing hardware dropped, solid modeling software was developed for personal computers. In 1995, the SolidWorks Corporation released SolidWorks"
