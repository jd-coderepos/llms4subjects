                "\"Author's Preface How to Manage Emotions in Design Innovation In today's time frame, emotions are paramount to people, and emotional relationships are becoming more and more desirable. An extension of emotional relationships is the affinity we feel with the products that we consume in this physical world. It has become essential to explore a manner in which emotions play a vital role in the physical world with which we surround ourselves. Our ambitions, desires, and needs are all driven by our emotions. The products in the physical world support and propel these aspirations and can be seen as a reflection of our emotional desires. This has implications in the architecture design, interior design, fashion design, design of home appliances, automobiles, lifestyle products, etc. The physical world can thereby be seen as an extension of emotion-based human aspirations. Styling is an integral part of any product design and development process. During the styling process, a designer imparts emotive qualities to products. With the diminishing technological differences among products, these emotive qualities play an increasingly significant role in enhancing the desirability and sense of ownership towards the product. However, the absence of quantitative tools to evaluate and determine the emotive quality required in product innovation leads to uncertainty in the styling process. The Concept of Emoha This book proposes a new emotion-centered research framework for product styling that can be used for managing emotions in design innovation process\"--",
                "\"This book presents an emotion centered research framework titled \"emoha\" for design innovation. It defines emoha and underlines the importance of the developed framework in culturalization of technology and thereby design innovation. The book explains the detailed research on product styling which leads to the creation of \"Emoha\" and how to use it in product design\"--"
