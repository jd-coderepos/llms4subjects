Beginning with the history and background of FinTech in financial services, the book provides a thorough overview of the global FinTech ecosystem and the drivers behind innovation in technologies, business models and distribution channels. Case studies of best practice examples and interviews with innovators, experts and academics shine a light on key financial innovation hubs in UK, US, Poland, China, Israel and more, and offer advice for institutions looking to choose the right market for their needs. Covering genuine innovations in AI, machine learning, blockchain and digital identity, Reinventing Banking and Finance offers practical solutions to navigating the complex and multi-layered finance industry.\"",
