            "abstract": "\"Recent technological advancements in green nanotechnology have opened a brand new avenue for research and development in the field of medicinal plants-mediated nanoparticles, biopolymer, biotechnology, and antimicrobial and biomedical research. This new volume, Green Nanomaterials: Sustainable Technologies and Applications, explores a number of eco-friendly technologies in green materials synthesis, which are of considerable importance. It takes an inter- and cross-multidisciplinary approach to the green chemistry of nanoengineering and green nanotechnology application in materials research. It provides informative coverage of this exciting and dynamic new field as well as relates the fundamentals of soft-nanomaterials fabrication and brand new spectroscopic integration. The book explores bio-inspired self-assembly green nanomaterials for multifunctional applications as well as the design and synthesis of green polymeric nanomaterials for a number of pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, including biosensors, drug delivery, antimicrobial applications, etc. Also discussed is the fabrication of green polymer nanocomposites from waste and natural fibers, such as chitin fiber, chitin whisker fiber, cellulose fiber, nano cellulose fiber, eggshells, and cotton waste. The book is a unique mixture of exclusive ideas from peer-reviewed papers, reports from the latest research newsletters, mini reviews, and invited papers on key developments in the field. It will be a helpful resource for scientists and researchers, industry professionals, and faculty and advanced students in this area\"--",
