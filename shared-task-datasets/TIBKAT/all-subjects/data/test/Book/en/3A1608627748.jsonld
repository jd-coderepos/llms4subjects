            "abstract": "\"Preface The rapid development of computing, communications, and sensing technologies has been enabling new potential applications of advanced control of complex systems like smart power grids, biological processes, distributed computing networks, transportation systems, and robotic networks. Signi cant problems are to integrally deal with the fundamental system characteristics such as nonlinearity, dimensionality, uncertainty, and information constraints, and diverse kinds of networked behaviors, which may arise from quantization, data sampling, and impulsive events. Physical systems are inherently nonlinear and interconnected in nature. Signi cant progress has been made on nonlinear control systems in the past three decades. However, new system analysis and design tools that are capable of addressing more communication and networking issues are still highly desired to handle the emerging theoretical challenges underlying the new engineering problems. As an example, small quantization errors may cause the performance of a \\well-designed\" nonlinear control system to deteriorate. The need for new tools motivates this book, the purpose of which is to present a set of novel analysis and design tools to address the newly arising theoretical problems from the viewpoint of dynamic networks. The results are intended to help solve real-world nonlinear control problems, including quantized control and distributed control aspects\"--",
