                "This textbook is specifically designed to meet the needs of students taking the two-semester calculus-based introductory physics courses now favored in many countries around the world. Accordingly, it is more concise than the extremely long standard textbooks, but offers the same modern approach and format. All core topics in classical physics are covered using straightforward language, including mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and optics. The necessary mathematics is developed along the way, rigorously and clearly. The book also features a wealth of solved examples, which will deepen readers\u2019 conceptual comprehension and hone their problem-solving skills. In addition, some 430 problems and 400 multiple-choice questions serve to review key concepts and assess readers\u2019 progress. The material in the book has been successfully employed in classroom teaching for the past decade, during which time it has been successively refined. Given its scope, format and approach, the book is the ideal choice for all science, engineering, and medical students embarking on an introductory physics course."
