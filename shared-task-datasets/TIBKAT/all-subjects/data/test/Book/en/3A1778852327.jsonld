            "abstract": "\"This book provides comprehensive analysis of a number of groundwater issues, ranging from flow to pollution problems. Several scenarios are considered throughout, including flow in leaky, unconfined, and confined geological formations, crossover flow behavior from confined to confined, to semi-confined to unconfined and groundwater pollution in dual media. Several mathematical concepts are employed to include into the mathematical models' complexities of the geological formation, including classical differential operators, fractional derivatives and integral operators, fractal mapping, randomness, piecewise differential, and integral operators. It suggests several new and modified models to better predict anomalous behaviours of the flow and movement of pollution within complex geological formations. Numerous mathematical techniques are employed to ensure that all suggested models are well-suited, and different techniques including analytical methods and numerical methods are used to derive exact and numerical solutions of different groundwater models. Features: Includes modified numerical and analytical methods for solving new and modified models for groundwater flow and transport Presents new flow and transform models for groundwater transport in complex geological formations Examines fractal and crossover behaviors and their mathematical formulations Mathematical Analysis of Groundwater Flow Models serves as a valuable resource for graduate and PhD students as well as researchers working within the field of groundwater modeling\"--",
