It's important to your client's success or your business's growth. But, there are few best practices out there, and the guidelines to designing a successful app are even fewer. Designing Apps for Success is here to help, covering application lifecycle management used by designers and developers when creating successful, capable apps. From the early discussions with a client about what kind of product they're looking for, to storyboarding, cross-platform developing, troubleshooting, and publishing, Designing Apps for Success provides a taut, concise, and pragmatic roadmap. This guide shows you how to develop apps for iOS, Android, and Windows. And, for those who don't program, zero-code tools are covered as well\"--",
