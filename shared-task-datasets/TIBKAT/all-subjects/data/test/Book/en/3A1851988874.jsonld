            "abstract": "\"Combining practical design strategies with urban theory, She City explores how gender inequity is materialized in cities worldwide, providing an activist toolkit for architects and urban designers to challenge gender bias, sexual harassment, and violence against women through their designs. Part I provides a contemporary survey of the current state of gender inequity in cities, revealing how one's gender impacts mobility, safety, and the ability to occupy public space. Focussing on the intersectional experiences of women and girls in the urban domain, this eye-opening theoretical groundwork exposes the impact of gender stereotypes and systemic power dynamics as they intersect with the architectural and urban fabric. Part II moves from theory to practice, examining a range of contemporary case studies - from positioning benches in public spaces to large-scale projects ensuring safety for sex workers - to show how better urban design can positively challenge gender inequity. Case studies are global - including New York, New Orleans, London, Zurich, Delhi, Cairo, Tokyo, and Bangkok - and range from collaborative co-designs with local women and girls, through to cutting-edge urban designs which actively contribute to women's access, security, and empowerment in the city. Case studies are critiqued and evaluated, to show what works and why, and to provide innovative and thought-provoking ideas for the designer wishing to make a positive impact\"--",
