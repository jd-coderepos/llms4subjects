Through a comparative focus on Iran and Turkey, Mona Tajali examines the activities and strategies of women\u2019s rights groups across the ideological spectrum. She explores how various groups have negotiated with political elites in order to bolster female political representation and identifies the conditions that stimulate greater support to ease women\u2019s path to political office. Studying how women\u2019s groups manoeuvre within these structures is important to help our understanding of the gendered politics of autocratic regimes",
