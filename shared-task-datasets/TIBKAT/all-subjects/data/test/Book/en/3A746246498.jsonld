            "abstract": "The author says it best, \"I hope to move you, a little at a time, from understanding C to the point where C++ becomes your mindset\". This remarkable book is designed to streamline the process of learning C++ in a way that discusses programming problems, why they exist, and the approach C++ has taken to solve such problems. \"You can't just look at C++ as a collection of features; some of the features make no sense in isolation. You can only use the sum of the parts if you are thinking about design, not simply coding. To understand C++, you must understand the problems with C and with programming in general. This book discusses programming problems, why they are problems, and the approach C++ has taken to solve such problems. Thus, the set of features that I explain in each chapter will be based on the way that I see a particular type of problem being solved in C++.\" Tailor made to treat difficult concepts in a simple and practical way, the book focuses on building a customizable model for the reader which helps in deducing the solution of any puzzle that one might encounter. The book presents the material one simple step at a time, so the reader can easily digest each concept before moving on. It uses examples that are as simple and as short as possible. This book does not to use any particular vendors version of C++ because, for learning the language, the details of a particular implementation are not as important as the language itself. All code in the book was run against the Visual Studio (Microsoft) C++ compiler and Apple's Xcode C++ compiler to ensure accuracy",
