            "abstract": "Classical Athens perfected direct democracy. The plays of this ancient Greek state are still staged today. These achievements are rightly revered. Less well known is the other side of this success story. Democratic Athens completely transformed warfare and became a superpower. The Athenian armed forces were unmatched in size and professionalism. This book explores the major reasons behind this military success. It shows how democracy helped the Athenians to be better soldiers. For the first time David M. Pritchard studies, together, all four branches of the armed forces. He focuses on the background of those who fought Athens's wars and on what they thought about doing so. His book reveals the common practices that Athens used right across the armed forces and shows how Athens's pro-war culture had a big impact on civilian life. The book puts the study of Athenian democracy at war on an entirely new footing",
