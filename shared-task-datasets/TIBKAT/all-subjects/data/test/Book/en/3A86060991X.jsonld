                "This innovative book takes a comparative approach to the social origin-education-destination triangle (OED), looking at the intergenerational transmission of advantage in 14 countries. The intention is to debate the claim that education is the 'great social equalizer'. The contributors examine the relation between family background, education and occupational achievement over time and across educational levels, focusing on the relationship between individuals' social origins and their income and occupational outcomes. It will be of interest to academics and students of social policy and those",
