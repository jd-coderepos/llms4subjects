                "The First International Conference on Digital Rights Management: Technology, Issues, Challenges and Systems (DRMTICS \u2013 pronounced \u2018dramatics\u2019), took place in Sydney, Australia on 31st October - 2nd November, 2005. It was or- nized by the Centre for Information Security of the University of Wollongong and in cooperation with the International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR) and IEEE Computer Society\u2019s Task Force on Information Assurance. DRMTICS isan internationalconferenceseriesthat coversthe areaof digital rights management, including research advancements of an applied and theor- ical nature. The goal is to have a broad coverage of the ?eld and related issues and subjects as the area evolves. Since the Internet and the computing infr- tructure has turned into a marketplace for content where information goods of various kinds are exchanged, this area is expected to grow and be part of the ongoing evolution of the information society. The DRM area is a unique blend of many diverse disciplines that include mathematics and cryptography, legal and social aspects, signal processing and watermarking, game theory, infor- tion theory, software and systems design and business analysis, and DRMTICS attempts to cover as much ground as possible, and to cover new results that will further spur new investigations on the foundations and practices of DRM. We hope that this ?rst conference marks the beginning of a fruitful and useful series of future conferences. This year, the conference received 57 submissions out of which 26 were - cepted for presentation after a rigorous refereeing process.",
