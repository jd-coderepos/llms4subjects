                "This book addresses to the materials scientists, physicists, chemists, biologists, and electrical engineers engaged in fundamental and applied research or technical investigations on such materials. The goal of the International Symposium on Dielectric Materials and Applications conference series is to provide an innovative platform for key researchers, scientists from all over the world to exchange ideas and to hold wide ranging discussions on recent developments in dielectric materials and their new and emerging applications. The aim of ISyDMA meeting is to provide an international forum for the discussion of current research on high k-dielectric, electrical insulation, dielectric phenomena, and topics related to emerging applications.",
