                "This volume contains state of the engineering practice and recent research in the field of built infrastructure and natural hazards. It is expected that the book will help engineers and researchers to design and built resilient infrastructures in challenging conditions (e.g., earthquakes and climate change) while optimising the design and minimising the future maintenance cost. In particular new design and construction techniques with reference to major infrastructure projects such as tunneling and transport infrastructure are discussed.",
