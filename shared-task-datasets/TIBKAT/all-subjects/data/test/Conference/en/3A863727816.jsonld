            "abstract": "This volume focuses on the cutting edge of vibrational spectroscopy and development of clinically relevant diagnostic tools for current challenges and emerging opportunities in biomedical applications. There have been significant advances in vibrational biomedical spectroscopy and many aspects of associated biophotonics in recent years. Large array detectors suitable for rapid scanning FTIR are now commonplace, tuneable infrared quantum cascade lasers are now available, deep Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a significant breakthrough technique and nonlinear Raman microscopes offer exciting new possibilities in the area of cell biology. There has also been a revolution in near field methods (e.g. tip enhanced Raman and Infrared, TERS AFM-IR, SNOM), all of which have been used on biomedical samples and accelerator based infrared sources continue to evolve. Diagnostic and prognostic tools based on these new technologies have the potential to revolutionise our clinical systems leading to improved patient outcome, more efficient public services and significant economic savings for healthcare providers and society. There are, however, many fundamental scientific and technological questions that we need to address before such techniques can be incorporated into the clinical arena",
