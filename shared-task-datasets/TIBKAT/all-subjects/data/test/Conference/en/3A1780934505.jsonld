                "This book features selected works presented in the 28th National Conference on Condensed Matter Physics, \u201cCondensed Matter Days (CMDAYS) 2020\u201d, which was held from December 11th to 13th December 2020. The conference brought together seasoned experts and upcoming researchers from all over India to share their research and ideas in the field of condensed matter physics. This book is a glimpse into the works and ideas that were discussed and presented at the conference. It includes works on diverse fields from nanomaterials to fuel cells, photocatalysis to ferromagnetism, application studies to fundamental studies.",
