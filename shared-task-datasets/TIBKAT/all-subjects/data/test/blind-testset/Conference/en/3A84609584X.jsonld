            "abstract": "\"Despite being at the forefront of high-tech innovation in architecture, Chris Wilkinson OBE RA is an architect who believes passionately in the importance of drawing by hand. Where many practices are now dominated by computer-aided design, Wilkinson still uses drawing as a way to think through ideas, to grapple with design problems and as a tool of communication. This volume brings together images selected from 20 years of Wilkinson's sketchbooks, presenting a fascinating record of the creation of architectural narrative. This unique insight into the working drawings of a hugely influential architect includes sketches for many of his practice's most groundbreaking works -- from structures for the London Olympics to the restoration and reconstruction of the three Grade II listed gas holders in King's Cross, London -- as well as a gazetteer with photographs of the completed projects.\" -- Publisher's description",
