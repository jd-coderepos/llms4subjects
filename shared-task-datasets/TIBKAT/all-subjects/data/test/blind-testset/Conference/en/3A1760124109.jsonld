                "This proceedings volume gathers a selection of outstanding research papers presented at the third Conference on Isogeometric Analysis and Applications, held in Delft, The Netherlands, in April 2018. This conference series, previously held in Linz, Austria, in 2012 and Annweiler am Trifels, Germany, in 2014, has created an international forum for interaction between scientists and practitioners working in this rapidly developing field. Isogeometric analysis is a groundbreaking computational approach that aims to bridge the gap between numerical analysis and computational geometry modeling by integrating the finite element method and related numerical simulation techniques into the computer-aided design workflow, and vice versa. The methodology has matured over the last decade both in terms of our theoretical understanding, its mathematical foundation and the robustness and efficiency of its practical implementations. This development has enabled scientists and practitioners to tackle challenging new applications at the frontiers of research in science and engineering and attracted early adopters for this his novel computer-aided design and engineering technology in industry. The IGAA 2018 conference brought together experts on isogeometric analysis theory and application, share their insights into challenging industrial applications and to discuss the latest developments as well as the directions of future research and development that are required to make isogeometric analysis an established mainstream technology.",
