DCAI 2020 is a forum to present applications of innovative techniques for studying and solving complex problems in artificial intelligence and computing areas. This year\u2019s technical program will present both high quality and diversity, with contributions in well-established and evolving areas of research. Specifically, 83 papers were submitted to main track and special sessions, by authors from 26 different countries representing a truly \u201cwide area network\u201d of research activity. The DCAI\u201920 technical program has selected 35 papers and, as in past editions, it will be special issues in ranked journals. This symposium is organized by the University of L'Aquila (Italy). We would like to thank all the contributing authors, the members of the Program Committee and the sponsors (IBM, Armundia Group, EurAI, AEPIA, APPIA, CINI, OIT, UGR, HU, SCU, USAL, AIR Institute and UNIVAQ). .",
