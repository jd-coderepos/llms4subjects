                "This volume contains contributions based on the lectures delivered and posters presented at the Fifth International Conference on Quantum Communication, Measurement and Computing (QCM&C-Y2K). This Conference is the fifth of a successful series hosted this time in Italy, was held in Capri, 3-7 July, 2000. The conference was attended by more than 200 participants from all over the world. There was also a high level of participation from graduate students, who greatly benefited from the opportunity to attend world-class conferences. The Conference Hall was hosted in La Residenza Hotel in Capri, where part of p- ticipants where housed, while others where housed in various cozy nearby - tels. All enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere offered by the island of Capri. There were 59 invited lectures given as oral presentations of 30 minutes and 94 poster papers. The major topics covered at the Conference where new experimental and theoretical results in quantum information. They were divided in five parts; i) Quantum Information and Communication, ii) Quantum Measurement, - coherence, and Tomography, iii) Quantum Computing, iv) Cryptography, v) Entanglement and Teleportation. We were lucky in that almost all major - perimental groups in the world working in this area were represented, as were the major theoreticians. There was very active audience participation. A n- ber of graduate students and post-docs were able to present their contributions in four after dinner poster sessions.",
