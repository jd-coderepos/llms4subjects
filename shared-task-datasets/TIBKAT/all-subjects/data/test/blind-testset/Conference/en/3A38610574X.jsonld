            "abstract": "The papers in this volume study political-economy aspects of policy associated with globalization: while globalization has generated efficiency gains, the resolution of the associated domestic income-redistribution consequences has in general involved political processes. The papers are divided into two groups, with the first group being concerned with issues of trade policy and the second considering policies with regard to immigration, the environment, foreign aid, and competition. As a group, the research papers in the first part of the volume not only cover key trade policy issues that are driven by the globalization process but also provide a comprehensive review of the modeling approaches of endogenous trade policy theory.
