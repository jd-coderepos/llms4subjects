                "Research on advertising, branding and communication from an international perspective is essential in the face of the growing globalisation of markets, which requires academics and practitioners to take an increasingly international orientation in developing communication policies. Researchers as well as advertisers and marketers are confronted with an expanding, and above all changing, variety of both traditional and new media available for communication purposes, among them, advergames, mobile marketing and viral marketing. The goal of this book is to advance more systematic research in these fields from an international orientation. Renowned communication researchers from around the globe have contributed to the making of this book."
