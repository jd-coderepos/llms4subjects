Discrepancy analysis of complex objects using dissimilarities -- A Bayes evaluation criterion for decision trees -- Classifying very-high-dimensional data with random forests of oblique decision trees -- Intensive use of correspondence analysis for large scale content-based image retrieval -- Toward a better integration of spatial relations in learning with graphical models. Part 2: Unsupervised learning. Multigranular manipulations for OLAP querying -- A new approach for unsupervised classification in image segmentation -- Cluster-dependent feature selection through a weighted learning paradigm -- Two variants of the OKM for overlapping clustering -- A stable decomposition algorithm for dynamic social network analysis. Part 3: Security and data streaming. An hybrid data stream summarizing approach by sampling and clustering -- SPAMS: a novel incremental approach for sequential pattern mining in data streams -- Mining common outliers for intrusion detection -- Intrusion detections in collaborative organizations by preserving privacy. Part 4: Ontologies and Semantic [i.e. semantics]. Alignment-based partitioning of large-scale ontologies -- Learning ontologies with deep lass hierarchies by mining the content of relational databases -- Semantic analysis for the geospatial semantic web -- Statistically valid links and anti-links between words and between documents: applying TourneBool randomization",
