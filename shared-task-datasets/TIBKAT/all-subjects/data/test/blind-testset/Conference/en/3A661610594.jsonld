                "\"This book contains the documentation from the 19th meeting of the European Consortium for Church and State Research, which was held in Nicosia, Cyprus on 15 - 18 November 2007. The aim of the conference was to provide an overview of the different legal ways in which the Member States of the European Union interpret in their domestic legal orders, the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights which relate to religious freedom. The meeting comprised participants from all EU member states. This widespread participation is mirrored in the contributions of this book. There are national reports from all Member States of the European Union, except for Belgium and Malta. Each national report contains translated extracts of the most important national legal decisions concerning the theme of the book. Prof. Jean Duffar has provided an overall introduction to the subject, while Prof. Malcolm Evans has provided a synthesis of the national reports\"--Provided by publisher",
