                "This book gathers the proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Advancements of Medicine and Health Care through Technology, held virtually on 13 \u2013 15 October 2020, from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. It reports on both theoretical and practical developments fostering the use of cutting-edge technology in clinical settings, telemedicine, and biological research. Chapters mainly deal with medical devices, measurements and instrumentation, medical imaging and biological signal processing and health care information systems. Further topics include modeling, simulation and biomechanics, as well as innovative (bio-)materials for biomedical applications. The conference, as well as the realization of this book, was supported by the Romanian Society for Medical Engineering and Biological Technology. ."
