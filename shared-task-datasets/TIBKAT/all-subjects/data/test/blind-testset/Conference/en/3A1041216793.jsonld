                "This book constitutes the refereed conference proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming, ILP 2018, held in Ferrara, Italy, in September 2018. The 10 full papers presented were carefully reviewed and selected from numerous submissions. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a subfield of machine learning, which originally relied on logic programming as a uniform representation language for expressing examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. Due to its strong representation formalism, based on first-order logic, ILP provides an excellent means for multi-relational learning and data mining, and more generally for learning from structured data"
