            "abstract": "South American camelids (Llamas, Alpacas, Vicu\u00f1as and Guanacos) are receiving increased interest not only in South America but also on a worldwide scale. They possess some unique features such as their fine fibre and healthy meat, and their high adaptivity to many climatic regions across the world. Apart from the important productive aspects, their physical attractiveness and friendly temperament also makes them popular as pet animals. There are still many gaps in the scientific literature with regard to South American camelids. In part, this gap can be diminished by this collection of papers which brings the experience of both European and South American researchers working together.The main themes considered in this book are the following: nutrition and feeding, meat production and the meat market, ecology, fibre production and the fibre market, animal breeding, animal health and pathology and socio-economical aspects. The particular advantages of South American camelids for the sustainable use of fragile ecosystems with native pastures are also outlined.'South American camelids research' is aimed at scientists and animal breeders as well as students studying veterinary, animal and applied biological sciences. It can be of further reference to farmers and traders of fibre and meat products. Please note that most articles are written in Spanish",
