                "A beautifully designed monograph showcasing important projects from the past 15 years by the highly successful Swedish office. The latest publication from Swedish architects Tham & Videg\u00e5rd, \"The Operative Elements of Architecture\" accompanies the exhibition with the same name in Paris this spring. The exhibition, in itself conceived as a contextual project, continues the practice's ongoing discussion on the fundamentals of architecture; a series of aspects and observations that T&V have labeled The Operative Elements of Architecture. With examples from built and ongoing projects, presented through a rich material of models, drawings and photographs, T&V elaborate on what constitutes architecture and how the T&Vteam's interest in multiple contexts influences each specific project. Exhibition: Galerie d'architecture, Paris, France (18.04-17.05.2014)",
                "\"Tham & Videg\u00e5rd Arkitekter are based in Stockholm and directed by the co-founders Bolle Tham and Martin Videg\u00e5rd. The Operative Elements of Architecture introduces 40 works and the principal ideas that guide their practice  from large scale urban planning through to buildings and interiors. It includes the Creek House, the House Lagn\u00f6, the Ordos 100 and the Tree Hotel, as well as public buildings such as the two Museums of Art in Kalmar and Malm\u00f6, the new KTH School of Architecture and the urban strategic plan for New Kiruna. Also including 8 new and previously unpublished projects.\"--"
