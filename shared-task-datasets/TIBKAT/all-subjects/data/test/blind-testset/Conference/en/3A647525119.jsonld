                "The volume consists of a collection of invited research papers and expository/survey articles, many of which were presented at the International Conference on Ring and Module Theory held at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, in August 2008. The selected papers and articles examine wide ranging and cutting edge developments in various areas of algebra, including ring theory, module theory, and commutative algebra. There is also a section devoted to open problems to motivate further research.",
                "Thisvolumeisacollectionof13peerreviewedpapersconsistingofexpository/s- vey articles and research papers by 24 authors. Many of these papers were presented at the International Conference on Ring and Module Theory held at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey, during August 18-22, 2008. The selected papers and articles examine wide ranging and cutting edge - velopments in various areas of Algebra including Ring Theory, Module Theory, Hopf Algebras, and Commutative Algebra. The survey articles are by well-known experts in their respective areas and provide an overview which is useful for - searchers in the area, as well as, for researchers looking for new or related ?elds to investigate. The research papers give a taste of current research. We feel the variety of topics will be of interest to both graduate students and researchers. We wish to thank the large number of conference participants from over 20 countries, the contributors to this volume, and the referees. Encouragement and supportfromHacettepe University,The Scienti?c and TechnologicalResearch \u00a8 ? Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) and Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism are greatly appreciated.
