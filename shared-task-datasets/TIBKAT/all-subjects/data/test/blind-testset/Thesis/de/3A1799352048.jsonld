                "Coprinopsis cinerea, the gray shagged ink-cap, is a saprotrophic edible basidiomycete that naturally grows on horse dung. Despite richness in nutrients, the typical fast autolysis of the cap of the mushroom during maturation lowers the potential consumption value. In the field of science, for more than a century the fungus served as an excellent model mushroom for studying fungal sex and mating types, the fruiting body developmental process, hyphal growth with asexual sporulation (oidiation) on primary and secondary mycelia (sterile monokaryons and fertile dikaryons), physiology and general genetics in basidiomycetes.Fruiting body development in C. cinerea takes place on dikaryons (mycelia after mating of two compatible monokaryons) at 25 \u00b0C and follows a conserved scheme defined by day and night phases, with well predictable distinct stages over the time. It thus takes 7 days to complete the fruiting pathway. The differentiation process starts with the formation of initial hyphal aggregations called primary hyphal knots (Pks) generated in the dark on Day 0 of the fruiting pathway, followed by light-induced compact aggregates, termed secondary hyphal knots (Sks) on Day 1 in which subsequently primordial stipe and cap tissues differentiate. When no light signal is received, Pks will be differentiated into multicellular dormant resting bodies called sclerotia instead of developing into a light-induced fruiting body. Primordium development starting from Sks over the stages P1 to P5 takes five days to culminate on Day 6 of development in karyogamy and meiosis within the basidia and subsequent basidiospore production which parallels fruiting body maturation (stipe elongation and cap expansion). Mature fruiting bodies autolyze on Day 7 of the standard fruiting pathway to release the basidiospores in liquid droplets to the ground. Primordia of C. cinerea are the complex multicellular structures during which the formation, the differentiation and the degeneration of various types of cells and tissues take place over the time of development to form a complete and complex multicellular fruiting structure from a simple hyphal knot. Such a fruiting process is strictly controlled by various environmental and genetic factors that have a direct influence on the morphological characteristics of the fungus. Despite extensive work in the past, it is still mostly unknown what constitutes the complex multicellularity of the fungus. The self-compatible homokaryotic strain AmutBmut with an established genome sequence was used to conduct the experiments in this thesis. The strain is well accessible to classical and molecular genetics, by transformation of asexual spores (oidia) produced in light. By mutations in the two mating-type loci A and B it mimics a dikaryon and is therefore able to fruit without mating to another compatible monokaryon. Individual genes in the process of fruiting bogy development can thus be studied in a throughout homogenic haploid background.This research focuses on understanding the complexities in fruiting body formation, using histochemical and microscopy techniques. The study provides detailed morphological descriptions on the initial hyphal knot stages and the different primordial stages (P1 to P5) which proceed to form a mature mushroom were exactly defined regarding time scale and morphology. Within a typical culture, hundreds of Sks are initiated. During the further developmental processes, at every stage substantial parts of structures abandon in development and only few reach fruiting body maturation. Abortive structures with slightly grayish dry caps can be distinguished from continuing structures by pinkish, fresh looking caps excreting liquid. Furthermore, to understand the complex cytological processes during stipe and cap development, fresh ongoing stages P1 to P5 primordia were identified, harvested and provided for a first proteome pilot study that detected many proteins known to contribute to specific steps in the development. Further, liquid droplets excreted from the actively growing primordia were collected and provided for a proteomic analysis which revealed within the droplets many secreted proteins with potential defense functions against bacteria, fungi, small animals and viruses.This study in addition examined how environmental factors such as light and dark, and aeration and CO2 control the entire fruiting process. Changes in these factors can alter the normal phenotypes of the primordial stages in the standard fruiting pathway. In the dark and under increased CO2, homokaryon AmutBmut as wildtype strain will form so-called \u201cdark stipes\u201d with length-extended stipes and underdeveloped caps. Four mutants in genes dst1, dst2, dst3 and dst4 produce such dark stipes under standard fruiting conditions and were analyzed in morphology. dst1 and dst2 are UV and REMI mutants and were already known to have defects in the WC1 photoreceptor and a FAD/FMN-containing dehydrogenase, respectively. These mutants are blind at the Sk stage and form dark stipes under standard fruiting conditions and are also blind with respect to loss of light-induced oidiation.  UV mutant 7K17 (dst3) and REMI mutant B1918 (dst4) of homokaryon AmutBmut have dark stipe defects initiating formation later in the development at the stages P3 and P4, respectively, with dark stipes seen at the stages P4 and P5. However, light regulation of oidia production was normal in mutant B1918 and also still active in mutant 7K17 but with lower effectivity, indicating that these mutants were not per se blind. Whole-genome sequencing identified each two interesting mutations in these strains related to TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and acetolactate synthase (ILV2) in 7K17 and in a citrate synthase and in subunit CSN5 of the Cop9 signalosome in B1918. Both mutants, therefore, are possibly blocked in feeding acetyl into the TCA cycle. The Cop9 (for constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome coordinates light and respiratory activities with developmental processes and is conserved in all eukaryotes. A further focus was given to genes participating in initiation of the fruiting pathway and primordial tissue formation, with a specific family of NWD2 genes for small NTPase. NWD2 genes encode proteins with a NACHT domain, an evolutionarily conserved domain that serves in signal transduction and is named after four different types of P-loop NTPases found in animals and fungi (NAIP, CIITA, HET-E, and TP1). Genome searches in C. cinerea found in total 36 different NWD2 genes which cluster into 7 different subgroups (A to G) in an evolutionary tree of all the encoded NWD2 proteins. Few other individual Agaricomycetes (Amanita muscaria, Agaricus bisporus, C. cinerea, Galerina marginata, Gymnopus luxurians, Hebeloma cylindrosporum, Hypholoma sublateritium, Hypsizygus marmoreus, Laccaria amethystina, Moniliophthora roreri, and Laccaria bicolor) from different families have related genes while their proteins cluster in species-specific manner. Accordingly, duplication and modification of genes of NWD2 proteins have taken place within the fungi. Presence of transposable elements, location of the duplicated genes in the unconserved regions of chromosomes close to telomeres and accumulation of a maximum number of genes in the C. cinerea shortest, little conserved and likely youngest chromosome together with the random distribution in a few other fungal species suggest horizontal gene transfer during evolution at the level of speciation. In previous studies, one specific NWD2 gene from subgroup A was found by transformation to suppress the fruiting defect and other unusal phenotypes in a pkn defective mutant Proto159. This mutant, was isolated of AmutBmut after protoplasting and regeneration of oidia, is unable to produce Pks, has a slower and thinner mycelial growth than homokaryon AmutBmut and stains the agar with submerged mycelium of cultures brown. The introduction of other NWD2 genes of subgroup A into mutant Proto159 by transformation in this study variably altered mutant mycelial properties, blocked the brown staining of submerged mycelium and the agar, and, most importantly, induced primary hyphal knot and sclerotia formation in the vegetative mycelium and also lead to the production of fruiting bodies.$yLinzenz"
