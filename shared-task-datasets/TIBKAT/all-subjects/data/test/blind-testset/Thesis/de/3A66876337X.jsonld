                "The internist Georg Canter (1885-1940) is so far most commonly known as a pioneer of peritoneal dialysis. Doubtlessly, he was a trailblazer in this field: Not only recognizing the characteristics of peritoneum to use as detoxication, he was also the first one to apply it within patient symptomatic therapy in terms of peritoneal irrigation or pleuroclysis. This dissertation is the first available monograph reflecting on Georg Ganter: The historical classification of the peritoneal dialysis and Ganter's impact on it were examined comprehensively. In addition, his whole field of medical work was analyzed. Worth mentioning are his cardiovascular research as well as his exploration of the gastrointestinal tract. Ganter's various phases of life were processed in the biographical part. Special attention was paid to his career progression during the National Socialism. Details were worked out showing why Georg Ganter, being an opponent of the National Socialism's regime, was deposed from his academic tasks in 1937."
