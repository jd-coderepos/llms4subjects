                "Species have to cope with climate change either by migration or by adaptation and acclimatisation. Especially for long-living tree species with a low seed dispersal capacity (e.g. European beech, hereafter called beech), the in situ responses through genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity play an important role for their persistence. Beech, the dominant climax tree species in Central Europe, shows a high drought sensitivity and its distribution range is expected to shift northwards. On the other hand, projected northward shifts need to be taken with caution, as some studies suggest a sensitivity of beech to frost events in winter and spring. However, studies on the growth performance of cold-marginal beech populations are still rare. Previous studies on beech populations found local adaptation to drought and phenotypic plasticity in fitness-related traits as well as phenological traits. However, studies on the regeneration of beech under natural conditions are yet missing, although germination and establishment of young trees are a very first selective bottleneck and are crucial for tree population persistence and for successful range shifts. This PhD-thesis aimed to identify the potential of plasticity and local adaptation in the important early life-history traits germination, establishment after the 1st year, and survival after the 2nd year in a reciprocal transplantation experiment at 11 sites across and even beyond the distribution range of beech (Manuscript 1) ...",
