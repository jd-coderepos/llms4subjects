            "abstract": "Mars is accompanied by two small natural satellites. Deimos, the smaller of the two, is orbiting at a greater distance from Mars while Phobos revolves around the planet at a mean altitude of approximately 6,000km with respect to the Martian surface, deep in the gravity field of the planet. An in-depth study of the irregular shaped moon Phobos was commenced due to remaining questions on its orbital motion, shape, and physical parameters based on new high resolution images of the Super Resolution Channel (SRC) and the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) which are part of the European Mars Express Mission (MEX). Parameters of ephemerides models were questioned after the finding of large discrepancies of Phobos' position to astrometric observations. During the course of this study astrometric measurements were made in fly-by images of Phobos and through observations of Phobos' shadow on the Martian surface. While results of the latter analysis led to largely scattered differences compared to orbit prediction models with high uncertainties, the fly-by observations were in agreement with the ephemerides models within the error bands. Offsets were rather consistent and systematic indicating that Phobos is ahead of its predicted position by approximately 2 km. To be able to model the irregular shape of Phobos by means of different techniques - namely a digital terrain model and a model based on spherical harmonic functions - a new global control point network was established. The 665 object point coordinates with respect to the Phobos body-fixed coordinate frame were determined through observations in 53 SRC and 16 Viking Orbiter images ...",
