            "title": "Investigation of a group farrowing system regarding behaviour and skin injuries of sows and piglets and the piglets\u00b4 body weight gain",
            "abstract": "Welfare concerns regarding farrowing and lactating sows, commonly kept in single housing systems with farrowing crates, have led to an intensifying social debate, also being the subject of recent political considerations in Germany. The aim of this study was to analyse a free farrowing system with regard to its animal friendliness for sows and piglets, which was designed to be easily installed on commercial farms and offered space for a group of five lactating sows. Therefore, sows\u00b4 and piglets\u00b4 behaviour, skin injuries as well as piglets\u00b4 weight gain were analysed during lactation. The piglets\u00b4 skin lesions and weight gain in group housing (GH) were compared to piglets kept in conventional individual housing (IH), before and after weaning. The investigated GH-system was located on the research farm of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation (Germany), and consisted of five farrowing pens (ca. 5 m\u00b2), a central common area (11.6 m\u00b2) as well as an area which was only available for the piglets (piglet area 1.8 m\u00b2). Inside the pens, rubber bollards and flexible iron bars replaced the farrowing crate to protect the piglets from being crushed by the sow. Three farrowing pens were equipped with less perforated plastic flooring (0.7 %), where straw could be provided daily, whereas the both remaining pens were fitted with more highly perforated plastic flooring (29 %) including a central lying area. Flexible steps at the entrance of the pens prevented the piglets from leaving the pens during their first days of life until they were physically able to master the steps. Sows could leave the pens by easily crossing the steps, thus being able to move freely within the housing system. In IH, sows were confined to farrowing crates throughout the housing period and piglets remained separated from foreign litters. The piglets were weaned 35 days post-partum on average in both housing systems. In total, data of 25 sows kept in GH and 34 litters kept in GH and IH were studied in a total of five batches. Video-observations were carried out to determine the activity and location of sows and piglets in GH. The suckling behaviour including cross-suckling was analysed by direct recording and the dunging behaviour by scoring the soiling of the different floor areas in GH. Skin lesions of several parts of the sows\u00b4 and piglets\u00b4 bodies were assessed by using a cumulative lesion score. Additionally, the occurrence of sows\u00b4 shoulder lesions was documented. At weaning, some piglets were chosen for a further experiment and mixed into groups of ten, with five piglets from two different litters each. The two different litters within a group originated from the same farrowing system. Skin injuries and daily weight gain of these piglets were recorded. The piglets left the farrowing pens 10.6 days post-partum in GH, corresponding to the behaviour under semi-natural conditions. Between parturition and the time before the piglets could leave the farrowing pens, sows spent most of their time inside the pens together with their litters (p < 0.05). Visiting a pen other than their own occurred very rarely. During this time, the lowest faecal-soiling was found for the pens and the significantly highest for the common area (p < 0.05). When the piglets were able to leave the pens, sows and piglets abandoned their previous pens, spending time in different areas of the housing system and frequently using the common area. Thereby, the piglets preferred the proximity to the mother sow in comparison to the pens where they were born. This was most obvious immediately after they had left the pens. As standing and walking as well as playing were observed most frequently in the common area, it became evident that this area was intensively used for active behaviour by sows and piglets. Comparing the different types of pen flooring designs, it was found that sows preferred the pens with a lower amount of floor perforation where straw was provided (p < 0.05). The suckling frequency remained nearly constant during the entire lactation period and cross-suckling occurred rarely. In 48.9 % of cases of cross-suckling, the piglets suckled permanently at the same foreign sow throughout the lactation period. In the remaining cases, the piglets changed between different foreign sows. The cumulative lesion score of the sows decreased in the course of the housing period (p < 0.05), while the lesion score of the piglets increased after they had left the pens and became familiar with piglets from foreign litters, resulting in higher lesion scores in GH compared to piglets from IH four days after leaving the pens (p < 0.05). The occurrence of shoulder lesions in sows was low, hardly increasing during the housing period. At weaning, the body weights of the piglets from IH were higher compared to those from GH (p < 0.05). In contrast, during the first four days after mixing at weaning, piglets from GH had higher daily weight gains and sustained fewer injuries compared to the piglets from IH (p < 0.05). The results of the present study indicated that sows and piglets kept in the group housing system were allowed to perform natural behaviour patterns. The different areas and thus the increased space allowance of the GH-system were intensively used. Keeping sows in the GH-system did not result in increased injurious behaviours, such as aggressive interactions between the sows during the housing period and did not affect the suckling frequency either. However, pre-weaning group housing reduced the occurrence of skin lesions and led to higher daily weight gains in piglets after weaning, potentially associated with less stress after mixing. Hence, the GH-system may provide benefits regarding the welfare of sows and piglets. However, further research under practical farming conditions would be useful to reveal whether the indicated findings can be confirmed in practice. Furthermore, the farmers\u00b4 workload as well as the sows\u00b4 performance kept within the GH should be ascertained, since these are important factors for the commercial acceptance of a housing system. High piglet losses due to crushing by sows still often pose a problem in alternative farrowing systems. This has to be overcome before these systems are accepted in conventional pig production. However, the findings of this study concerning potential welfare benefits of sows and piglets might be of relevance with regard to the current political discussion as well as the increasing public demand for more animal-friendly housing systems.",
