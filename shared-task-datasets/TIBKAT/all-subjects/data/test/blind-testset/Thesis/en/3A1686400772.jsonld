            "abstract": "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, characterized by aberrations of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Patients show symptoms due to reduced blood coagulation. VWD was also related to angiodysplasia and increased miscarriage rates with unknown cause. This study characterizes a porcine model for VWD type 1 (V1) and 3 (V3) regarding expression and distribution of angiogenic mediators in the female reproductive tract of non-pregnant and pregnant sows at placentation. Histology of uteri, oviducts, ovaries and placentae was investigated as well as gene and protein expression of the following angiogenic mediators: VWF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2 and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains (Tie)-1 and Tie-2. Angiodysplasia was found in the uteri of both non-pregnant V3 animals. VEGF gene expression was increased in the uteri and placentae of affected animals. VEGFR-2 expression was reduced in uteri and placentae of pregnant V1 sows. This implicates increased pro-angiogenic influence of VEGF, maybe prevented in the uteroplacental unit. A shift of integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 from the apical membrane of uterine epithelial cells to the cytoplasm in VWD animals was found. In placentae of V1 animals, ITGB3 gene and integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 protein expression were reduced, maybe affecting blood vessels and implantation. Increased ITGAV gene expression in ovaries points to involvement of both subunits. Ratios of components of the ANG/TIE system differed and immunohistochemistry results for Ang-2 revealed varying staining patterns among genotypes. Lower Ang-2 expression in V1 placentae may lead to insufficient angiogenic signaling, pointing to tissue specific influence of VWF on Ang-2. These results make those animals a promising model to further investigate the influence of VWF on angiogenesis in the female reproductive tract in vivo.",
