                "Amine transaminases are versatile biocatalysts for the production of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant chiral amines. They represent an environmentally benign alternative to waste intensive transition metal catalysed synthesis strategies, especially because of their high stereoselectivity and robustness. Therefore, they have been frequently used in the (chemo)enzymatic synthesis of amines and/or became attractive targets for enzyme engineering especially in the last decade, mainly in order to enlarge their substrate scope. Certainly, one of the most notable examples of amine transaminase engineering is the manufacturing of the anti-diabetic drug Sitagliptin in large scale after several rounds of protein engineering. Thereby, the target amine was produced in asymmetric synthesis mode which is the most convenient and favored route to a target chiral amine, starting from the corresponding ketone. The choice of the amine donor is highly relevant for reaction design in terms of economical and thermodynamic considerations. For instance, the use of alanine as the natural amine donor is one of the most common strategies for the amination of target ketones but needs the involvement of auxiliary enzymes to shift the reaction equilibrium towards product formation. In fact, isopropylamine is probably one of the most favored donor molecules since it is cheap and achiral but it is supposed to be accepted only by a limited number of amine transaminases. This thesis focusses on ...",
