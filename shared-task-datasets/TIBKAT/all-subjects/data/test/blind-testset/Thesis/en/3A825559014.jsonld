            "abstract": "Supposed portfolio benefits of commodities and the increased availability of commodity linked investment products such as index funds contribute to a financialization of agricultural commodity markets. The parallel increase in price levels and short-term volatility for almost all major agricultural commodities and a growth in trading volume on their derivative markets triggered a debate about the underlying causal linkage. In particular, financial \u201cindex trading\u201d, i.e. taking long positions in the futures markets and rolling these forward, has been suspected to inflate prices above fundamentally justifiable levels by creating artificial demand on the futures markets. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the price effects from the financialization of agricultural commodity markets, specifically focusing on (i) the robustness and interpretability of findings from previous empirical studies on direct price effects of index trading; (ii) volatility linkages between agricultural commodity and financial asset markets as a result of financial portfolio strategies; and (iii) direct price level or volatility effects on single agricultural commodity markets from portfolio inclusion of commodity index funds.",
