            "abstract": "Abstract: A well-established navigation method is one of the essential conditions to achieve a successful minimally-invasive brain intervention: it should be accurate, safe and online operable. For instance, in electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS), which involves delivering therapeutic electrical pulses via chronically implanted electrodes to the target brain regions through minimally-invasive surgical procedures, pre-operative MRT images are commonly used to guide the electrode implantation procedure in the surgery. To further facilitate a neuronal scale localization, microelectrode mapping that characterizes electrophysiological properties of the respective neuron types is often adopted as a complementary localization modality. Unfortunately, pre-operative image guidances may lose accuracy due to registration error or brain shifting during the surgery. Recent research has shown that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a potential solution for this application by providing a high resolution and small probe dimension. When integrating the fiber-based OCT imaging with multi-site neurophysiological recordings, it is believed this multi-mode navigation modality will allow neurosurgeon to perform the minimally-invasive neurointervention with improved accuracy and efficacy.<br><br>In this study, a fiber-based spectral-domain OCT system utilizing a superluminescent diode (SLD) with the center wavelength of 840 nm providing 14.5 \u00b5m axial resolution was used as the imaging modality. A composite 125 \u00b5m diameter detecting probe with a gradient index (GRIN) fiber fused to a single mode fiber was employed. Signals acquired from forwarding-scanning were reconstructed into grayscale images by horizontally aligning A-scans from the same trajectory at different depths. The reconstructed images were able to display brain morphology along the fiber insertion trajectory. For scans of typical white matter, the signals showed a higher intensity of backscattered light with lower penetration depth, as well as a steeper attenuation slope compared to the scans typical for gray matter. The tissue's optical attenuation properties were then extracted from OCT A-scans. 16-channel polyimide-based thin-film microelectrode, of which the entire shank is 365 \u00b5m wide and 15 mm long, was used to facilitate neuroelectrophysiological recordings. The electrode was integrated with the OCT single mode fiber to construct a multi-mode microprobe assembly. Electrophysiological signals were o ...",
