            "abstract": "This dissertation focuses on a wide range of biogeographic and macroecological aspects of bird and fern species from Bolivia. In the first chapter I outlined the general purpose of this dissertation, as well as general concepts and implications of large-scale studies. In the second chapter I used the databank of fern species from Bolivia to evaluate the level to which the geographical incomplete data availability of species occurrence affects the perception of species richness and endemism. I performed, for this purpose, a cumulative temporal analysis of the aforementioned databank in a grid context. The patterns of species richness were temporally consistent. The richest areas were always placed along the humid-montane forests, even though collecting intensity were also higher in this area than in others. Endemism, on the other hand, had a lower degree of correlation with collecting intensity, and the resulting endemism spatial patterns were temporally inconsistent ...",
