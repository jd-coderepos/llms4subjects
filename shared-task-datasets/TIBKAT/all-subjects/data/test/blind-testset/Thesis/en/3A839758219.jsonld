                "Problem: The thesis contains an analysis of 50 protocolled poetry group sessions in psychiatry in Germany between 1985 and 1987. Method: The first 25 poetry group sessions (PGS) take place in a closed psychiatric ward while the last 25 are performed in an open psychiatric ward. These PGS consist in reading in turn a poetic text chosen by the therapeutic team subsequently followed by a partly free, partly structured group conversation by the group therapist. Meanwhile the group therapist protocols the PGS in the beginning schematically than detailed. Finally the PGS conclude with a therapist team meeting without the patients' presence. A regular conversation history during the PGS can be observed which lead to the development of a Five-phase-rule: Phase 1: Interpretation of the text, Phase 2: Valuation of the text or the protagonist, Phase 3: Introducing own experiences in relation to the content of the text, Phase 4: Group conversation dissolves from text, Phase 5: Exchange of experiences, feelings, opinions, memories, desires and hopes independent of the text. Further a classification of the chosen texts arises during processing the protocolled PGS: in very suitable, well- suited and moderately suitable literature. The classification is based on 10 evaluation criteria. With the help of the statistical tests Kendall\u015b Tau and Goodman and Kruskal\u015b Gamma a correlation between classification of literature and the Five-phase-rule will be examined in conclusion.
