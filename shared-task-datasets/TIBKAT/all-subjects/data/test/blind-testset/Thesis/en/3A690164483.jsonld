            "abstract": "In this methodological study, three new and more practical adaptive plot designs (I, II and III) are introduced with an overall objective to improve the efficiency of sampling rare and geographically clustered populations in forest inventories and ecological surveys. Plot design I and II are proposed for fixed-area plot sampling and plot design III for relascope sampling. They all employ a simple approach of conditional one-off expansion of initial plots\u02ba: whenever an observed value from an initial sample plot satisfies a predefined condition in terms of a critical value (CrV), an expanded plot will be installed there. Thereby their adaptation processes need not to be conducted in a time-consuming and error-prone sequential fashion as known in the conventional adaptive cluster sampling. Under plot design I and III, the plot size factor (PSF) defines how much larger the expanded plot area is in relation to the initial plot. An expanded plot under plot design II consists of five subplots, four of which are additionally installed at a given distance (subplot distance) from the sample point ...",
