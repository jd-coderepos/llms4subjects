            "abstract": "My thesis is concerned with the study of optimal control problems for the non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are a mathematical model to describe the behaviour of fluid flows. Simply speaking, we are considering the minimization of an objective function J(y, u) depending on control u and velocity field y subject to the state equation condensed to NS(y, u) = 0. This work is not the first on that particular subject. Many other authors have contributed their results. As a pioneering work stands the article of Abergel and Temam, where the first optimal control problem for fluid flows was considered, and where also the first existence and optimality conditions can be found. My thesis follows these classical attempt and will repeat known results, but also adds some new insight to this subject. At first an overview of the governing equations is given. It provides some functional analytic background material such as function spaces and weak solution concepts. Each control action requires a reaction of the flow. Though in real life this reaction should be unique, the mathematical theory does not yet provide such a result for three-dimensional problems for low regular data. In the two dimensional case this reaction is unique, and the mapping control-to-velocity field can be studied. It turns out that this mapping is even twice Fr\u00e9chet differentiable, which enables us to use well-known Banach space programming techniques later on ...",
