                "The controlled drug-targeting of a dosage form to a particular part of the gastrointestinal tract is an important point concerning an increasing effectiveness and bioavailability as well as reduced side effects. Therefore, the physiological differences along the intestinal tract regarding pH, transit and microbial colonization can be used. However, various factors such as food intake or pathophysiological changes can lead to a fail of pH - , time - or enzyme -triggered dosage forms. They could release their active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) either too early, too late or not at all. With the development of new dosage forms releasing their active ingredient based on a defined pressure, these problems could possibly be avoided. Another point which can negatively affect the bioavailability in the human body, with particular respect to poorly soluble drugs, is the exact time and duration of the disintegration of a dosage form and a lack of the required volume of liquid in the gastrointestinal tract. Especially drugs with a narrow absorption window in the upper small intestine depend on a rapid dissolution process of the active ingredient of a dosage form to provide an optimal absorption. For this reason, the aim of the present work was the development of new pressure-sensitive dosage forms, releasing their content immediately and completely at a defined pressure of 300 mbar, which is predominant at the pylorus. The dosage forms should not release their API due to a prolonged ..."
