            "abstract": "A scientific field and an academic discipline can be characterized mainly by four basic issues: Function, body of knowledge, research methodology, transfer from research (theory) to practice. In this book issues of research methodology related to sport and exercise science are covered by ten authors as a comprehensive introduction for study and research. It is valid for the wide range of disciplines and main topics of sport and exercise science. Therefore hermeneutics (words) and statistics (numbers) are equally represented. An extensive introduction deals with aspects of foundation, concept, intention, and structure of the book. The book contains in six parts 12 chapters, which are organized in a logical sequence for research methodology. Thus the introductory intention of the book for study and research is followed by leading the reader from chapter 1 to 12 through the different aspects of a research process in a logical manner. Each part is introduced by perspectives, chapter overviews and key words. Each chapter begins with an introduction, a flow chart representing the content, a detailed content table and study objectives. Tables and figures illustrate the content. At the end of each chapter a summary and references are included. Issues of research methodology for sport and exercise science are presented in this reader-friendly format, in order to introduce the reader to study and research related to sport and exercise science",
