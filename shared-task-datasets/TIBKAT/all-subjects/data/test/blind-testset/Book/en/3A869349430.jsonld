                "\"For many years, 'anglistik & englischunterricht' has been devoted to the exploration of a wide range of questions within the field of British and American culture and the teaching of culture. The objective of the first volume on globalisation is to provide a diverse approach to the problem area of globalisation, which, perhaps more than any other issue, needs to be addressed from a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives. It is, however, also self-evident that the number of specific questions to be covered within the scope of this volume is necessarily very limited and cannot serve as a systematic introduction to a problem area that, by definition, defies any such endeavour. Therefore, the publication offers a selection of contributions from linguistic, literary, film and cultural studies with a partly strong focus on teaching on secondary and tertiary levels. The volume should offer valuable insights not only for teachers at schools and universities but also for the interested public.\" --",
