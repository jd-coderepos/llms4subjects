                "Explore the world-changing digital transformation in China  China's Mobile Economy: Opportunities in the Largest and Fastest Information Consumption Boom is a cutting-edge text that spotlights the digital transformation in China. Organised into three major areas of the digital economy within China, this ground-breaking book explores the surge in e-commerce of consumer goods, the way in which multi-screen and mobile Internet use has increased in popularity, and the cultural emphasis on the mobile Internet as a source of lifestyle- and entertainment-based content. Targeted at the global business community, this lucid and engaging text guides business leaders, investors, investment banking professionals, corporate advisors, and consultants in grasping the challenges and opportunities created by China's emerging mobile economy, and its debut onto the global stage.  Year 2014-15 marks the most important inflection point in the history of the internet in China. Almost overnight, the world&rsquo;s largest digitally-connected middle class went both mobile and multi-screen (smart phone, tablets, laptops and more), with huge implications for how consumers behave and what companies need to do to successfully compete. As next-generation mobile devices and services take off, China&rsquo;s strength in this arena will transform it from a global &ldquo;trend follower&rdquo; to a &ldquo;trend setter.&rdquo;   Understand what the digital transformation in China is, and impact on global capital markets, foreign investors, consumer companies, and the global economy as a whole  Explore the e-commerce consumption boom in the context of the Chinese market  Understand the implications of the multi-screen age and mobile Internet for China's consumers  See how mobile Internet use, its focus on lifestyle and entertainment is aligned with today's Chinese culture  Learn about the mobile entertainment habits of China&rsquo;s millennial generation and the corresponding new advertisement approaches   The development of China&rsquo;s mobile economy is one of the most important trends that will reshape the future of business, technology and society both in China and the world. China's Mobile Economy: Opportunities in the Largest and Fastest Information Consumption Boom&nbsp;introduces you to the digital transformation in China, and explains how this transformation has the potential to transform both China and the global consumer landscape.",
                "The book will focus on three major areas of the digital economy in China that are, by nature, inter-linked: (a) The boom of e-commerce on consumer goods. Alibaba's online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall have nearly twice as many active buyers than the U.S. site eBay. It has already disrupted new shopping malls in China, but itself is also being disrupted by the mobile culture and social network. The mobile disruption in China is more thorough than the developed world: immature industries such as retail and logistics will leapfrog straight from the early industrial age to the internet one. (b) The beginning of the multi-screen age and mobile Internet for China consumers. The mobile consumption is growing so rapidly that the shopping malls, a new development in China by itself, have already been disrupted by online-to-offline (O2O) retail consumption. What's more, the growth and positive spillovers go beyond consumer goods sector to services, entertainment, media, finance and even traditional industry sectors. (c) Mobile internet is more about lifestyle and entertainment for China's online community (which tends to be younger than that in the US). The Chinese youth are pouring money into online games, video and music downloading, and virtual goods/ online personas in imaginary worlds. To meet the quest for high quality contents, the tech giants are not only betting on set-top box to convert TV and theatre viewers to online but also creating their own contents; meanwhile, the China market is changing the DNA of Hollywood's blockbuster movie."
