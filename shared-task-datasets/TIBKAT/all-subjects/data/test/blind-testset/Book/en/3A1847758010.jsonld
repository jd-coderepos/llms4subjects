            "abstract": "\"Through the work of the Italian architect, theorist and historian Paolo Portoghesi (1931-present), this book offers a new perspective on postmodern architecture, showing the agency of other spheres of knowledge - history, politics and media - in the making of postmodern architectural discourse. It explores how Portoghesi's personal \"postmodern project\" is based on the triangulation of a renewed interest in historical architectural language, unprecedented use of media and intertwined links between architecture and politics. Organized in a sequence of critical chapters supported by the analysis of Portoghesi's most significant architectural projects - including Casa Baldi (1959), The Mosque in Rome (1975-95) and his Strada Novissima exhibition (1980) - and publications, the book unfolds around the three main themes of history, politics and media. Published as part of the Bloomsbury Studies in Modern Architecture series, which brings to light the work of significant yet overlooked modernist architects, the study features previously-unpublished archival material, interviews by the authors and articles from professional and mainstream press to present Portoghesi in his multifaceted role of mediator, politician, historian and designer\"--",
