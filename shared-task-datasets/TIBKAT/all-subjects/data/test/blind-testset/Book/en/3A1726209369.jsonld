            "abstract": "\"-- The book is organized in FOUR major Parts (SECTIONS) comprehensively addressing the state-of-the-art technological considerations on modern bioinformatics and the associated bioengineering/technology considerations. The chapters therein are structured in their contents and are tuned to describe the technology aspects of specifics involved as they exist now and as they are being transformed to meet the new options. More like case studies, these specific examples will be furnished and relevant topics will be addressed, studied, analyzed and presented. -- At the end of each chapter, a collection of exercises is indicated along with relevant examples and/or case-studies. They are designed as extensions to the contents of the chapters with an objective of enabling readers to improve their knowledge on the subject as well as enhance their skill in collecting (and learning) more details on the relevant topics from the archival of information deliberated in the vast literature as well as supercharged in the knowledge engines of multitudes of web pages. - -The examples presented and rider problems indicated thereof are not just for pedagogical and class-room applications of the academia. They are indicated to portray the bigger picture of practical implications in their right perspectives so as to assimilate the concepts of bioinformatics pertinent to modern bioengineering and biotechnology. This big picture painted also stresses the analytical questioning and problem-solving skills as being the key towards successful understanding of concepts and making best use of the prevailing knowledge of the subject-matter. A biotechnologist may also judiciously adopt the underlying concepts of these exercises to supplement their learning while exercising their endeavors of bio- and genetic engineering and while assaying the related molecular biosciences\"--",
