                "This book discusses the theory of third-order differential equations. Most of the results are derived from the results obtained for third-order linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. M. Gregus, in his book written in 1987, only deals with third-order linear differential equations. These findings are old, and new techniques have since been developed and new results obtained. Chapter 1 introduces the results for oscillation and non-oscillation of solutions of third-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients, and a brief introduction to delay differential equations is given. The oscillation and asymptotic behavior of non-oscillatory solutions of homogeneous third-order linear differential equations with variable coefficients are discussed in Ch. 2. The results are extended to third-order linear non-homogeneous equations in Ch. 3, while Ch. 4 explains the oscillation and non-oscillation results for homogeneous third-order nonlinear differential equations. Chapter 5 deals with the z-type oscillation and non-oscillation of third-order nonlinear and non-homogeneous differential equations. Chapter 6 is devoted to the study of third-order delay differential equations. Chapter 7 explains the stability of solutions of third-order equations. Some knowledge of differential equations, analysis and algebra is desirable, but not essential, in order to study the topic"
