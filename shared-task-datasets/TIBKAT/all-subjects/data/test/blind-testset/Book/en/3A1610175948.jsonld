            "title": "Sh\u012b'\u012b Islam : an introduction",
            "abstract": "\"During the formative period of Islam, in the first centuries after Mu\u1e25ammad's death, different ideas and beliefs abounded. It was during this period of roughly three centuries that two particular intellectual traditions emerged, Sunnism and Sh\u012b;'ism. Sunn\u012b Muslims endorsed the historical caliphate, while Sh\u012b'\u012b; Muslims, supporters of 'Ali, cousin of the Prophet and the fourth caliph, articulated their own distinctive doctrines. The Sunn\u012b-Sh\u012b'\u012b schism is often framed as a dispute over the identity of the successor to Mu\u1e25ammad, whereas in reality, Sunn\u012b and Sh\u012b'\u012b Muslims also differ on a number of seminal theological doctrines concerning the nature of God and legitimate political and religious authority. This book examines the development of Sh\u012b'\u012b Islam through the lenses of belief, narrative, and memory. In an accessible yet nuanced manner, it conceives of Sh\u012b'ism as a historical project undertaken by a segment of the early Muslim community that felt dispossessed. This book also covers, for the first time in English, a wide range of Sh\u012b'\u012b communities from the demographically predominant Twelvers to the transnational Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs to the scholar-activist Zayd\u012bs. The portrait of Sh\u012b'ism that emerges is that of a distinctive and vibrant community of Muslims with a remarkable capacity for reinvention and adaptation, grounded in a unique theological interpretation of Islam\"--",
