                "Why have food crises been more frequent in recent years, compared to the last few decades? This book examines an array of different distortions that are causing food supply chain dysfunction in many countries, particularly for staple non-perishable foods such as grains and pulses. It outlines the underlying changes that are currently occurring, which will have an influence on the direction of future food supply chains, and provides some solutions to the current food security problem. Based on an analysis from total regulation in the 1950s-60s through to deregulation during the 1980-90s, as well as post-deregulation, it focuses on liberal trade and deregulation as a more successful solution to stabilising food supply chains and distribution of storable food commodities. The author highlights a common thread of either farmers using government for vested-interest intervention, or autocratic governments seeking market and supply-chain power.  The book examines the role of government as expounded or perceived by government themselves after 50 years of food supply chain intervention. It discusses the role of 'trade' markets and cluster industries and how these can quickly disintegrate when price distortions occur. The author studies both food importing and exporting countries and concludes that commingled commoditization of food has lead to increasing hoarding, corruption, and dependence on food aid. He argues that a competitive food supply chain that has minimum intervention is more likely to provide future food security. In conclusion the book emphasises that adequate rewards and competition in the supply chain are the essences of sustainable food security."
