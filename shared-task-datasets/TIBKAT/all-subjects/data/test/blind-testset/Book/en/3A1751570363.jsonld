Volume 2: Crop Culture and Production provides the most up-to-date and helpful growing techniques and cultural details required by professional growers.

In Part 1 of this volume, you'll find chapters devoted to water, media, nutrition, pH, temperature, light, growth regulation, propagation, disease indexing, and postharvest care. Part 2 provides cultural details for more than 215 flower, herb, and vegetable crops (a 33% increase over the previous edition!) including an in-depth section on hemp and cannabis production. Each crop includes details about propagation, growing on, insect and disease control, troubleshooting, varieties, and postharvest care\"--",
