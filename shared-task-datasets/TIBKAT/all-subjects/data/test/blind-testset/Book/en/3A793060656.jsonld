                "\"Explains how to identify potential cyberattackers and how to recover from a cybercrime if you've been attacked\"--",
                "\" According to the U.S.Department of Justice, more than six million people are stalked each year in the United States alone. Don't become one of them! International cybercrime expert Alexis Moore can help protect you from the spurned lovers, angry neighbors, and jealous coworkers who use the Internet as the perfect way to exact revenge and wreak havoc on your life. In her essential book, she introduces the ten most common personality profiles of cyberstalkers--such as Attention-Getting, Jealous, Manipulative, Controlling, and Narcissistic--and their threatening online behaviors. Each chapter includes a quiz to help you identify the signs of that personality type in order to determine if you are in a potentially vulnerable relationship. Case studies illustrate how that particular cybercriminal operates, and Moore offers tips to prevent and/or recover from each type of cybercrime. She also provides strategies to help victims protect themselves, reestablish their reputations and credentials, recover from financial losses, and rebuild their lives. The techniques range from recovering data, monitoring online profiles and social media information, and regaining self-esteem to changing identities and even going underground.  \"--"
