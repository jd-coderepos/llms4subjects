            "abstract": "\"The book presents a new type of leadership focused on sustainable human development and organizational sustainability, which is based on the self-realization of the person of the leader, which means the satisfaction of their needs, according to the scale of Abraham Maslow, through integral human development in all aspects of life. Because speaking of a leader would seem to cite any person with the authority that confers a position that has subordinates, but the reality within organizations has shown that a leader goes further, requires commitment, awareness and concern for the common good. What person has these characteristics? People who have had more opportunity to develop in different areas of their being, which conceives them as more educated. The person is the basis of leadership. Education and exercise are much more important than all heredity and the genetic code. This volume explores the various ways of making explicit the dimensions of social, economic, and environmental sustainability through knowledge management that addresses the identification, collection, processing, circulation, use, exchange, and preservation of knowledge within operating systems and the context of organizations. considering issues that contribute to sustainability: human and organizational, where the leader is the main actor and the means is knowledge management\"--",
