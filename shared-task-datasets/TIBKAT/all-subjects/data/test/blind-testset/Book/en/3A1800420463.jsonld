            "abstract": "\"People working in our cyber world have access to a wide range of information including sensitive personal or corporate information which increases the risk to it. One of the aspects of the protection of this data is to train the user to behave more securely. This means that every person who handles sensitive information, their own or that of other people, be aware of the risks that their use can pose as well as how to do their job in such a way as to reduce that risk. The approach we use for that is called 'Security awareness' but would be more accurately described as security 'un-awareness' because most of the problem comes where the user doesn't know about a risk from their behaviour, or its potential impact. In these 'Post COVID days of 'New normal' working, in which staff spend more of their time working at home, organisations are still responsible for the protection of sensitive personal and corporate data. This means that it is more important than ever to create an effective security awareness communication process. This book will primarily consider the problem of hitting that 'Sweet Spot' in the age of 'New Normal working', that means that the knowledge about secure practice is not only understood and remembered, but also reliably put into practice - even when a person is working alone. This will be informed by academic research as well as experience, both my own and learnt from my fellow professionals and then used to demonstrate how 'New Normal' working can improve security awareness as well as challenge it\"--",
