                "\"The Cambridge History of the English Short Story is the first comprehensive volume to capture the literary history of the English short story. Charting the origins and generic development of the English short story to the present day, the historical development of the genre is presented in the first history of its kind. There is no single book that provides such an overview. Written by international experts in the field, this book covers numerous transnational and trans-historical connections between writers, modes and forms of transmission. Suitable for English Literature students and scholars of the English Short Story generally, this book has the potential to become a standard work of reference within its field\"--",
