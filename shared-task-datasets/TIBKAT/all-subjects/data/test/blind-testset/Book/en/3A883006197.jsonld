            "title": "Implicitness : from lexis to discourse",
            "abstract": "Although the term implicitness is ubiquitous in the pragmatic scholarship, it has rarely constituted the focus of attention per se. This book aims to help crystallize the concept of implicitness by defining its linguistic boundaries, as well as specifying and exploring its different communicative manifestations. The contributions by leading specialists scrutinize the main conceptualizations, forms and occurrences of implicitness (such as implicature, impliciture, explicature, entailment, presupposition, etc.) at different levels of linguistic organization. The volume focuses on phrasal, sentential, and discursive phenomena, showcasing the richness and variety of implicit forms of communication, systematizing (where possible) the existing analytic perspectives, and identifying the most productive procedures for further exploration. Taken together, the chapters exhibit theoretical differences that hinder a consensus on the nature of implicitness, but they simultaneously reveal methodological points of contact and raise common questions, thereby signposting a future analytic agenda. The book will appeal to both theoretically and empirically minded scholars working within and across the disciplines of Pragmatics, Semantics, Language Philosophy, Discourse Analysis, and Communication Studies.",
