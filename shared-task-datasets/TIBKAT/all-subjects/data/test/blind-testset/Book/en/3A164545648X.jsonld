Less attention has been paid to his artistic production, although he began his career as a painter. Le Corbusier indeed studied under Charles L'\u00c9splattenier and, together with the artist Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, founded the Purist movement in the manifesto After Cubism. Even after Le Corbusier turned to architecture, he continued to paint and draw. His thousands of drawings, rarely exhibited but meticulously stored in two watch cabinets from his family home, were particularly significant; he considered his work as a draftsman to be fundamental to his creative process. Beautifully illustrated with more than 300 drawings that have never before been published for an English readership, this revealing book charts the evolution of Le Corbusier's process from his youthful travels abroad to his arrival and maturation in Paris\"--Back cover",
