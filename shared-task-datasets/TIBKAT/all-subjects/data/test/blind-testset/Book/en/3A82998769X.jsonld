            "abstract": "During John V. Lindsay's Mayoral tenure in New York 1966-73, the city created innovative policy intended to draw on-location media production to New York's streets. Simultaneously, the New York City Planning Commission and associated offices produced a wealth of documents that reflect conceptual and aesthetic influences of various visual media. American architect McLain Clutter undertook to analyse to what remarkable extent the effects of these two areas of political ambition were interrelated. In his new book Imaginary Apparatus, Clutter describes the relationship between New York City and its mediated representation at the conjuncture of these circumstances, tracing the interrelation of their attendant cultural, economic and aesthetic valences. The second part of the book explores the legacy of Lindsay's policies by analysing their effects on New York City's built environment. Clutter illustrates his argument with a large selection of photographs and film-stills, many of them previously unpublished, and with original documents from various archives. This ground-breaking new book is rounded out with a DVD featuring 'What is the City but the People?', the film version of the study 'Plan for New York City 'of 1969, a unique document that has never before been publicly available",
