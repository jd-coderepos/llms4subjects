            "abstract": "\"Some important English novels have been popular; some have not; but ours is not a history of bestsellers. To be sure, the novel is not an entirely autonomous literary form, developing in isolation from the influence of market forces or of politics, national or international. Far from it: no one could seriously make such an argument. And yet if the novel sees at all - if it offers unique insights - it does so above all through the ceaseless making, breaking, and remaking of literary forms. Every decision that a novelist makes is formally mediated, and thinking through those decisions provides access to the history of the novel as such. By attending to this history of formal innovations one begins to understand the range and depth of which the English novel has been capable. We hope, even though the Cambridge History concludes by affirming the enduring power of romance, that our way of turning the novel's progress into history is less quixotic than the quest of the Knight of the Woeful Countenance\"--",
