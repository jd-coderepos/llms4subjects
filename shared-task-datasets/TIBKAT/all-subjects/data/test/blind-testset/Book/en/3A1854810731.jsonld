It further provides a comparative analysis of various advanced security approaches such as edge computing, cybersecurity, and cloud computing in the realm of information technology. Address the challenges in designing blockchain-based secured solutions for Industry 4.0 applications using artificial intelligence. Provides a comparative analysis of various advanced security approaches such as edge computing, cybersecurity, and cloud computing in the realm of information technology. Discusses the evolution of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology, from fundamental theories to practical aspects. Illustrates the most recent research solutions that handle the security and privacy threats while considering the resource-constrained in Industry 4.0 devices. Showcases the methods and tools necessary for intelligent data analysis and gives solutions to problems resulting from automated data collection. The text aims to fill the gap between the theories of blockchain and its practical application in business, government, and defense among other areas. It further highlights the challenges associated with the use of blockchain for various industry 4.0 applications such as data analytics, software-defined networks, cyber-physical systems, drones, and cybersecurity. The text is primarily written for senior undergraduate, graduate students, and academic researchers in the fields of electrical engineering, electronics and communication engineering, computer engineering, manufacturing engineering, and industrial engineering\"--",
