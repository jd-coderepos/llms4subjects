                "\"Tropical living at its most chic. The planned community of Windsor, on a barrier island in Vero Beach, Florida, offers elegant-yet-casual seaside living at its best. This sublimely landscaped village, planned by the renowned New Urbanists Andr\u00e9s Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, boasts houses by A-list architects and top interior designers, among them John Stefanidis, Steven Gambrel, and Alessandra Branca. The exteriors, Anglo-Caribbean in style, feature steeply pitched roofs, open eaves, cantilevered balconies, and palm-shaded courtyards and pools. The interiors, all executed with exquisite craftsmanship and appointed with fine finishes, range in style from traditional to sleekly contemporary. Beachside presents a wide array of the houses, organized by room. Filled with photographs of bougainvillea-framed entrances, airy open-plan living-dining rooms, cozy studies, and bedrooms that open onto balconies with sweeping ocean views, Beachside will inspire anyone yearning for a stylish coastal life\"--Publisher's description",
