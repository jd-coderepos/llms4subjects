            "abstract": "Master Architects of Southern California 1920-1940, a new twelve-volume series by Marc Appleton and Bret Parsons showcases the work of the Golden Era's most important residential architects as originally featured in the earliest issues of The Architectural Digest.0In the latest volume, Wallace Neff, the authors focus on one of the most admired and influential residential architects to ever practice in Southern California. In a remarkable career that spanned over six decades, Wallace Neff produced hundreds of exceptional designs that ranged from vernacular styles to grand mansions, reaching from Bel-Air to Santa Barbara to Hollywood and Hancock Park, with a proliferation of homes in the Pasadena area. Neff's ability to work in a variety of styles that ranged from Spanish Colonial Revival to French Normandy with equal grace made him a favorite with those seeking the very best. His client list with names like Doheny, Pickford, Gillette, and Marx- reads like a \"Who's Who\" of the most important and influential figures of the era. Additionally, Neff was known for his \"Bubble Houses\" which he described as \"a revolutionary method providing for low-cost, labor-saving process of extremely rapid construction of permanent houses and buildings.\"",
