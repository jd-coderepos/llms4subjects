                "The book considers the underground development of cities from a systemic point of view. The authors' scientific methodology for planning a system of alternative design configurations in a metropolis (including underground infrastructure) on the basis of applied system analysis methods is revealed. The book presents a short guide and a number of practical applications of morphological analysis, cognitive modeling, and other system analysis methods as tools for solving various urban problems, including risk assessment in the transport infrastructure of a city; evaluation and justification of constructing different types of underground objects on a selected site according to its structural, functional and geological factors; construction of scenarios aimed at informed decision-making in planning complex underground facilities. The book provides novel and convenient tools for urban development to professionals in urban planning, municipal authorities and investors, and researchers in urban studies."
