            "abstract": "\"The book focuses on policy-making in various media sectors, including broadcasting, print and the new information and communications technologies (ICTs). A range of debates and issues around media policy-making in Southern Africa over the past few decades, are covered by a set of international scholars. Ideal for media policy enthusiasts, students and the general public, it covers media reform in Southern Africa and the rest of the world. A great deal of continuity and change have characterised media and communication policy-making in Southern Africa over the past two decades. Rapid political and economic developments spawned the adoption of 'second generation' reforms aimed at opening up the media to diverse and pluralistic interests in the context of ongoing democratisation projects. Moving from regional case studies that examine the political economy of media reform, the collection also looks into the future, while taking stock of what has been 'hit and missed' and how the current uncertain phase can be transcended. The aim is to take the debate on media reforms to a new level, following on policy 'maturation'\"--Publisher's website",
