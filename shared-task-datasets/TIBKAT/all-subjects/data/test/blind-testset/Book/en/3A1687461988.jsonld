                "Based on the water footprint (WF) concept, this book reviews WF-based water stress evaluation methods at the city, provincial and river basin levels respectively. In addition, it explores the factors that influence regional water footprint in the spatial sequence via the extended STIRPAT model. Highlighting the utilization of WF accounting in sustainable water management, one of the book\u2019s goals is to establish the optimization model of water allocation in various industrial sectors. Based on WF accounting, which thoroughly considers the water input for production, the relevant intermediate water inputs, and the water amount for wastewater discharge dilutions, the book provides a wealth of insights for scholars and practitioners with an interest in water resources and environmental management. In addition, it exhibits a scientific plan for regional water resource utilization and allocation, helping relieve regional water shortages",
