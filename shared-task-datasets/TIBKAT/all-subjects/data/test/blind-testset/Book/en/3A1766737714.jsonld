            "abstract": [
                "As food producers, plants are constantly under attack by insects. Over the course of evolution, plants have not only developed a sophisticated defense apparatus but have also refined biochemical defense mechanisms to protect themselves, thereby maintaining the ecological balance. Plant-pest interactions induce an elaborate array of reactions involving the release of volatile compounds, effector and signaling molecules, trans-membrane proteins, and a variety of enzymes and hormones. This book offers a comprehensive guide to the strategies that plants employ against insects and other pests to ensure their continued survival. Addressing an important gap in the literature, it shares the latest findings in the field of plant\u2013pest interactions for a broad audience. Providing an overview of the current state of knowledge on plant-pest interactions and their role in the genetic improvement of crops, it offers an essential guide for researchers and professionals in the fields of agriculture, plant pathology, entomology, cell biology, molecular biology and genetics.",
