It covers preparation and evaluation of nanocarbons, variety of carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphite, and additively manufactured 3D carbon fibres, their properties and various factors associated with them. Summary and outlook of the nanocarbon filed is included in the appendices. Features: Present a comprehensive information on nanocarbon synthesis and properties and some specific applications Covers growth of carbon nanoparticles, nanotubes, ribbons, graphene, graphene derivatives, porous /spongy phases, graphite, and 3D carbon fabrics Documents large variety of characterizations and evaluation on nature of growth causing effect onto structure-properties Contains dedicated chapters on miniaturized, flat, and 2D devices Discusses variety of applications from military to public domain including prevalent topics related to carbon. This book aims at researchers and graduate students in materials science and materials engineering, and physics\"--",
