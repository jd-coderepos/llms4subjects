                "\"Critical intercultural communication studies focuses on issues of power, context, socio-economic relations and historical/structural forces as these play out in culture and intercultural communication encounters, relationships, and contexts. Scholars in the field have imagined and envisioned what critical intercultural communication studies can be; however, The Handbook of Critical Intercultural Communication is the first resource to date that fully engages such imaginings. Because the theoretical and contextual range of critical intercultural communication studies is still developing and taking shape, this Handbook aims to furnish scholars with a consolidated resource of works that highlights all aspects of the field, its historical inception, logics, terms, and possibilities. This groundbreaking collection traces the historical steps and developments that enabled such a course of study while presenting new and vibrant possibilities of engaging culture and intercultural relations and contexts in a \"critical\" way. This handbook will help scholars revisit, assess, and reflect on the formation of critical intercultural communication studies and where it needs to go in terms of theorizing, knowledge production, and social justice engagement\"--"
