            "abstract": "\"The Blackwell Companion to Paul offers a comprehensive overview of the life, teachings and legacy of one of the founding figures of Christianity. In a series of chapters by internationally recognized academics, the major aspects of Paul's life and work are explored, as well as his influence on Christian thinkers and Christian belief over the centuries and his impact on less discussed areas such as art and literature. The result is a wonderfully rich and wide-ranging volume. The first section approaches the study of Paul and Christian origins, offering clear and skilful accounts of Paul's life and writings, and exploring their social and historical setting. The second part addresses the influence of Paul on a number of key Christian thinkers, including Origen, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther and Barth, among others, as well as examining Jewish, Orthodox and African readings of Paul. The third part tackles the legacy of Paul on key topics of Christian theology such as ethics and ecclesiology, but also on art and literature. The outstanding group of contributors offer a uniquely comprehensive and impressive account of the major areas of Paul's life and work, as well as providing insights into lesser explored areas. Stephen Westerholm is a leading figure in the field of Pauline Studies, and ideally placed to edit this timely and eagerly awaited volume\"--",
