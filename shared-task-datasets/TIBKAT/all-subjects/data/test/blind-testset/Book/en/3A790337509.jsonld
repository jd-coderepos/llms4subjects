            "abstract": "In recent years, research has gradually become more integrated in the profiles of schools of architecture and design. Simultaneously, the concept of Architecture and DesignResearchhas become increasingly diverse, differentiated and complex, as reflected by the dialogue with a number of different academic traditions and a growing interest in design-based research methods.0This anthology highlights the potentials and challenges for research in architecture and design. The included essays are based on papers given at a symposium held at the Aarhus School of Architecture in 2011 and contain a number of topical positions ranging from the activist and academic to practice-based and artistically-based research by international and Danish researchers. The anthology is aimed at architects and designers, as well as others with an interest in the discussion of the concept of research in the fields of architecture and design. The anthology is in English and richly illustrated",
