                "\"The Metasploit Framework makes discovering, exploiting, and sharing vulnerabilities quick and relatively painless. But while Metasploit is used by security professionals everywhere, documentation is lacking and the tool can be hard to grasp for first-time users. Metasploit: A Penetration Tester's Guide fills this gap by teaching you how to harness the Framework, use its many features, and interact with the vibrant community of Metasploit contributors. The authors begin by building a foundation for penetration testing and establishing a fundamental methodology. From there, they explain the Framework's conventions, interfaces, and module system, as they show you how to assess networks with Metasploit by launching simulated attacks. Having mastered the essentials, you'll move on to advanced penetration testing techniques, including network reconnaissance and enumeration, client-side attacks, devastating wireless attacks, and targeted social engineering attacks. Metasploit: A Penetration Tester's Guide will teach you how to:   Find and exploit unmaintained, misconfigured, and unpatched systems   Perform reconnaissance and find valuable information about your target   Bypass anti-virus technologies and circumvent security controls   Integrate Nmap, NeXpose, and Nessus with Metasploit to automate discovery   Use the Meterpreter shell to launch further attacks from inside the network   Harness standalone Metasploit utilities, third-party tools, and plug-ins   Learn how to write your own Meterpreter post exploitation modules and scripts   You'll even touch on exploit discovery for zero-day research, write a fuzzer, port existing exploits into the Framework, and learn how to cover your tracks. Whether your goal is to make your own networks more secure or to put someone else's to the test, Metasploit: A Penetration Tester's Guide will take you there and beyond\"--",
