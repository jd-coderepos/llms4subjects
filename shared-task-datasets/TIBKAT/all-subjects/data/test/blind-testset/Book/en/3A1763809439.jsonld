            "abstract": "\"Wear is one of the main reasons mechanical components and materials become inoperable, rendering enormous costs to society over time. Estimating wear allows engineers to predict the useful life of modern mechanical elements, reduce the costs of inoperability, or obtain optimal designs (i.e. selecting proper materials, shapes, and surface finishing according to mechanical conditions and durability) to reduce the impact of wear. Wear in Advanced Engineering Applications and Materials presents recent computational and practical research studying damage and wear in advanced engineering applications and materials. As such, this book covers numerical formulations based on the finite element method (FEM) - and the extended FEM (XFEM) - as well as theoretical and experimental research to predict the wear response or life-limiting failure of engineering applications. Contributions from leading experts and promising researchers give a detailed overview of different modern techniques and materials that can be considered by researchers and practicing engineers to reduce surface damager and wear in mechanical components and materials\"--",
