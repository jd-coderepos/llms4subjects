            "abstract": "And when gun enthusiasts talk about Constitutional liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment, they are referring to freedom in a general sense, but they also have something more specific in mind---freedom from government oppression. Guns, Democracy, and the Insurrectionist Idea reveals that the proponents of this view base their argument on a deliberate misreading of history. A myth has been forged by twisting the facts of the American Revolution and the founding of the United States, the denial of civil rights to African-Americans after the Civil War, and the rise of the Third Reich under Adolf Hitler. Here, Horwitz and Anderson set the record straight. The books also discusses issues regarding the NRA, D.C. v. Heller, German gun laws for Nazis during the Holocaust, property rights, and \"shoot first\" laws. Challenging the proposition that more guns equal more freedom, they expose Insurrectionism---not government oppression---as the true threat to freedom in the U.S. today. Joshua Horwitz is Executive Director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence",
