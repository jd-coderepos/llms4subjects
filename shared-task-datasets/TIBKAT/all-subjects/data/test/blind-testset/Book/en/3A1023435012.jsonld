            "abstract": "'This book is an ambitious intellectual enterprise to build a naturalistic foundation for economics, with amazingly vast knowledge of physical, biological, social sciences and philosophy. Readers will discover that approaches and insights emergent in institutional studies, (social)-neuroscience, network theory, ecological economics, bio-culture dualistic evolution, etc. are persuasively placed in a grand unified frame. It is written in a good Hayekian tradition. I recommend this book particularly to young readers who aspire to go beyond a narrowly specified discipline in the age of expanding communicability of knowledge and ideas.' (Masahiko Aoki, Stanford University, US). -- 'Carsten Herrmann-Pillath's new book is an in-depth application of natural philosophy to economics that draws up an entirely new framework for economic analysis. It offers path-breaking insights on the interactions between human economic activity and nature, and outlines a convincing solution to the long-standing reductionism controversy. A must-read for everyone interested in the philosophical underpinnings of economics as a science.' (Ulrich Witt, Max Planck Institute of Economics, Jena, Germany). -- '\"Big picture\" philosophy of economics drifted into a dull cul-de-sac as it became obsessively focused on falsifiability and rationality. In this book, Carsten Herrmann-Pillath pushes the field back onto the open highway by locating economics in the larger frameworks of metaphysics, evolutionary dynamics and information theory. This is large-scale, ambitious synthesis of ideas of the kind we expect from time to time to see devoted to physics and biology. Why should economics merit anything less? But of course, this kind of intellectual tapestry must await the appearance of an unusually devoted scholar, with special patience and eccentric independence from the pressure for quick returns that characterizes academic life. In the person of Herrmann-Pillath, this scholar has appeared. No one who wants to examine economics whole and in its richest context should miss his virtuoso performance in this book.'
