            "abstract": "The Women's Suffrage Movement is the first comprehensive reference work to bring together in one volume the wealth of information available on the individuals and organizations involved in the women's suffrage movement from the 1860s to the 1920s. This widely acclaimed book has been described by History Today as a 'landmark in the study of the women's movement'. It is the only comprehensive reference work to bring together in one volume the wealth of information available on the women's movement. Drawing on national and local archival sources, the book contains over 400 biographical entries and more than 800 entries on societies in England, Scotland and Wales. Easily accessible and rigorously cross-referenced, this invaluable resource covers not only the political developments of the campaign but provides insight into its cultural context, listing novels, plays and films. Review: 'A landmark in the study of the women's movement. The book is at once an invaluable research tool and a source of fascinating information on its subject. Author and publisher are to be congratulated on its publication. - History Today 'A wonderful source for researchers and general readers alike. This is a book that you can consult with a purpose or browse through at random. It informs, but it also diverts.' - Financial Times.",
