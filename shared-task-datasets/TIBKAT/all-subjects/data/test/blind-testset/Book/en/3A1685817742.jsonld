                "\"There is often little guidance available on how to teach in universities, despite there being increasing pressure to raise teaching standards, as well as no official requirement for academics to have any specific teaching qualification in many countries. This invaluable book comprehensively addresses this issue, providing an overview of teaching in a business school that covers all stages of student learning. This book demonstrates various ways to engage students and offers techniques to enhance teaching practice, focusing on particular challenges such as large group teaching, increasing attendance and engagement, and successful professional development. All the contributors have current experience of teaching in a business school, allowing them to offer honest, personal assessments of what is effective in practice. Chapters address specific topics such as technology enhanced learning, while useful 'thoughts' provide creative and innovative suggestions on improving participation and outcomes. Learning and Teaching in Higher Education will be an important resource for those teaching in a business school setting, as well as having significant value to anyone teaching in higher education more generally\"--",
