            "abstract": "\"Emily Bront\u00eb's incomparable Wuthering Heights is, for many of us, one of our most cherished novels, with the character of Heathcliff being the ultimate romantic hero. It is a work that has bewitched us for almost 200 years. But Emily herself remains an enigmatic, even mysterious figure, often painted unfairly in a negative light. So Emily Bront\u00eb Reappraised conjures a new image of the great writer by looking at her afresh from the vantage point of the new millennium. It's a biography with a twist, taking in the themes of her life and work - her feminism, her passion for the natural world - as well as the art she has inspired, and even the fake news stories about her. What we discover is that she was, in fact, a thoroughly modern woman. And now, in the 21st century, it's time for the real Emily Bront\u00eb to please stand up.\"--",
