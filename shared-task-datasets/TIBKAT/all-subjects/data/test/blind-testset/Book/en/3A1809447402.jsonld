            "abstract": "This book is a collection of comprehensive reviewed chapters covering major physiological aspects, both production as well as biochemical aspects, of a plant under low temperature stress. Low temperature stress has been dealt in two parts, first between 10 to 00 C and secondly between 0 to -400 C. This book highlights the physiological aspects of plants under low temperature stress and explains the various adaptive measures plants undergo to tolerate low temperature stress. Essential information is provided on germination, growth and development, dry matter accumulation, partitioning and final yield of a crop plant. As physiology deals with morphological and biochemical aspect of all the basic processes, therefore an in depth understanding the major physiological issues in plants under high temperature will help plant breeders to tailor different crop plants with desirable physiological traits to do better under higher temperature. The present book is intended to cover the effects of low temperature stress on the various physiological aspects in plants. Not only in production physiology, this book also deals with major biochemical processes, like photosynthesis, nitrogen and lipid metabolism, mineral nutrition and plant growth hormones. Efforts have been made deal with different measures to mitigate the effects of low temperature stress on plants. This book will be an asset for post graduate students, faculty members, researchers engaged in not only in physiological studies but also agronomy, plant breeding and like subjects. In depth analysis of the major physiological processes in plants under low temperature stress that are presented in this book will help plant breeders for tailoring crops for desirable physiological traits needed to survive and to give better economic return under the threats of low temperature stress. This book is also helpful for policy planners and industries engaged in agribusiness in short term as well as long term gain.",
