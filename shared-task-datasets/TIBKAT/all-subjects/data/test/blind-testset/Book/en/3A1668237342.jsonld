                "\"This book presents a vision of schools where teaching and learning are centered on creativity, a vision that is original, compelling, and applicable in the classroom. The message is that to be creative in any school subject, students need to learn a different kind of subject-area knowledge that he calls real knowledge. Real knowledge results in better student learning outcomes in all subjects, from science and math to history and language arts. At the same time, real knowledge enables students to create with that knowledge. In classrooms that lead to real knowledge, students master content-area standards at the same time that they increase their creative potential\"--",
