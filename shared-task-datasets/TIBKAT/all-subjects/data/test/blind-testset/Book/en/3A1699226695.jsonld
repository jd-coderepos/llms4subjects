                "\"This textbook provides a framework for teaching children's language and literacy and introduces research-based tactics for teachers to use in designing their literacy programs for children. Exploring how sense-making occurs in contemporary literacy practice, Murphy comprehensively covers major topics in literacy, including contemporary multimodal literacy practices, classroom discourse, literacy assessment, and teacher knowledge. Ideal for literacy courses, preservice teachers, teacher educators, and literacy scholars, this book illustrates how children become literate in contemporary society and how teachers can create the conditions for children to broaden and deepen their sense making and expressive efforts\"--",
