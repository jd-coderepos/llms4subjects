            "abstract": "\" Discourse-pragmatic markers are central to everyday  language, yet many aspects of their use and functions  remain elusive or under-investigated. Bringing together a  global team of leading scholars, this volume presents a  representative showcase of work currently being conducted  in the field of discourse-pragmatic variation and change,  including investigations of features such as uh/um, please,  sentence-final is all, and discourse-pragmatic features from  a number of languages. The book emphasizes that not only  have researchers answered the call to address complex  issues such as cross-linguistic reliability, extending research  across languages, and expanding and improving on  methods and analysis, but that they continue to address  perennial questions in the field of language variation and  change. With sections on theoretical and methodological  issues, innovative variables, and language contact  situations, the volume offers a robust overview of best  practices for both new and experienced researchers\"--",
