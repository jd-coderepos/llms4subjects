In a series of essays, it looks at ways in which ordinary Latin Americans determined their own history by bending the Cold War to local purposes\"--Provided by publisher\"--",
                "\"The dominant tradition in writing about U.S.-Latin American relations during the Cold War views the United States as all-powerful. That perspective, represented in the metaphor \"talons of the eagle,\" continues to influence much scholarly work down to the present day. The goal of this collection of essays is not to write the United States out of the picture but to explore the ways Latin American governments, groups, companies, organizations, and individuals promoted their own interests and perspectives.The book also challenges the tendency among scholars to see the Cold War as a simple clash of \"left\" and \"right.\" In various ways, several essays disassemble those categories and explore the complexities of the Cold War as it was experienced beneath the level of great-power relations\"--"
