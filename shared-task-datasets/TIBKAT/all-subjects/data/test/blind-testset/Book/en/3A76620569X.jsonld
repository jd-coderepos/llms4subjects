            "abstract": "This book describes a number of different empirical studies and evaluations of the international brewery industry. This industry has recently undergone two climactic changes within a ten to fifteen year time period. These are a significant industry-wide consolidation of firms and market shares accompanied by the internationalization of what was previously a largely local industry. Understanding the drivers and implications of such abrupt and massive change in the competitive environment of an industry is of great interest to international and strategic management scholars. Most of the books chapters address this issue, some at the global industry level, some at a regional level, and some at the level of a specific country. Taken together, they comprise an insightful case study of an interesting industry at its most interesting point in time. William G. Egelhoff, Fordham University, US The individual contributions in this volume paint a varied and rich picture of strategies and rivalries, the role of environments and institutions, leadership and also customer approaches in both global and local brewery industry. Some of the analysed phenomena are more standard to an IB audience, like consolidation, technological development, and shifts in global markets, but they get a specific flavor and color through this industry focus, while other topics definitely seem more specific (like \"Bierstrassen\" on Mallorca). For readers with good taste. Rian Drogendijk, Uppsala University, Sweden This unique book explores some of the key topics of international business through the context of a global industry, focusing on the challenges brewery companies face as they operate in globalized markets. It examines the strategies of individual firms to develop markets and explores new insights into recent company rivalries, both globally and locally. In addition, it offers detailed analysis of some of the major players in the industry through longitudinal studies. Drawing on a range of perspectives, the contributing authors explore six overarching themes: international market developments and firm performance; host country institutional effects; multi-point competition and rivalries; cross-border M&A integration and subsidiary development; leadership and internationalization; and boundless customer interfaces through such elements as social media and tourism. The Global Brewery Industry will prove insightful for scholars across international business, as well as providing an appeal ...",
