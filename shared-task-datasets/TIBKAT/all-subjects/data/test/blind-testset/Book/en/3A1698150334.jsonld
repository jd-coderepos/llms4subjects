                "The book asks: How are scientific developments impacting on human life and on the structure of societies? How is science regulated, and how should it be regulated? Are there ethical boundaries to scientific developments in some sensitive areas? (robotic intelligence, biosecurity?) --.",
                "Never before have the scope and limits of scientific freedom been more important or more under attack. New science, from artificial intelligence to gene editing, creates unique opportunities for making the world a better place. It also presents unprecedented dangers. This book is about the opportunities and challenges - moral, regulatory and existential - that face both science and society. How are scientific developments impacting on human life and on the structure of societies? How is science regulated and how should it be regulated? Are there ethical boundaries to scientific developments in sensitive areas? Such are the questions that the book seeks to answer. Both the survival of humankind and the continued existence of our planet are at stake. --."
