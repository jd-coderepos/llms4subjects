            "abstract": "Provides a comparative study of women\u2019s political participation and representation in contemporary Iran and Turkey Draws on 140 interviews with past and present female politicians and candidates, party elites, and women\u2019s rights activists in Iran and Turkey between 2009 to 2019Investigates women\u2019s political underrepresentation in Iran and Turkey by examining each respective country\u2019s electoral system, political party structure, government framework and state gender ideology Includes the voices, experiences and approaches of women\u2019s groups and political parties across the ideological spectrum in its analysis \u2013 from the Justice and Development Party and Women and Democracy Association in Turkey, to the Zeinab Society and Islamic Women\u2019s Coalition in IranHighlights Islamic women\u2019s agency as they challenge the gender discriminatory behaviours and attitudes of their male party leadersIncludes data and statistics related to the rate of women\u2019s candidacy and election to political office at the national level How have women in many Muslim-majority countries been able to achieve surprising success despite the significant constraints imposed by conservative gender ideology and authoritarian political parties and systems? Through a comparative focus on Iran and Turkey, Mona Tajali examines the activities and strategies of women\u2019s rights groups across the ideological spectrum. She explores how various groups have negotiated with political elites in order to bolster female political representation and identifies the conditions that stimulate greater support to ease women\u2019s path to political office. Studying how women\u2019s groups manoeuvre within these structures is important to help our understanding of the gendered politics of autocratic regimes",
