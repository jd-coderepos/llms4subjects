                "Introduction -- Part I: The TNI -- Origins and Institutional Development of the Armed Forces -- Doctrinal Change: from \"Total People'S Defense and Security\" to the \"New Paradigm\" -- Changes in the Intelligence Function -- The Changing Political Role of the Military -- Inside the TNI: Career Patterns, Factionalism, and Military Cohesion -- The Military's Funding and Economic Interests -- Part II: Security Challenges -- The Challenge of Terrorism and Religious Extremism -- Communal Conflict in Eastern and Central Indonesia -- Separatist Movements in Aceh and Papua -- Part III: The Future of U.S.-Indonesian Military Relations -- The Rocky Course of U.S.-Indonesian Military Relations -- Strategic Scenarios for Indonesia and Their Implications -- Goals for Indonesian Military Reform and Elements of a U.S. Engagement Strategy -- Appendix: Can Indonesia Meet the Leahy Amendment Conditions?. - The Indonesian military, with its tradition of secular nationalism, is one of the few institutions that cut across the divides of Indonesian society. As it continues to play a critical part in determining Indonesia's future development, the military itself is undergoing profound change. The authors of this book explore the role of the military in politics and society since the fall of President Suharto in 1998. They examine key research issues that are central to the strategic interests of the United States in Asia: Will the Indonesian military be a constructive force supporting democratic processes or will it opt for authoritarian solutions? What are some realistic goals for further progress on military reform? And how can the United States engage the Indonesian military most effectively to help bring about positive change? To answer these questions, the authors present several strategic scenarios for Indonesia, each of which has important implications for U.S.-Indonesian relations, and propose goals for Indonesian military reform and elements of a U.S. engagement policy",
