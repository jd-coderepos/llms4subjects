            "abstract": "When was left-hand driving enforced in Australia? When did women get the vote? When did the Garden Palace burn down? When was Vegemite invented? The answers to these questions, and more, are in \"What Happened When?\" This book should settle arguments, refresh memories, furnish some surprises and answer a lot of questions. The year-by-year arrangement of the text is designed to make it easy to use, and its 140 page index provides a valuable reference source, supplying answers to questions such as: What was Ben Chifley's full name? When was Nellie Melba born? In what year was \"Summer of the Seventeenth Doll\" filmed? Who wrote \"Such is Life?\" Who succeeded Sir Thomas Playford as Premier of South Australia? When did Delta win the Melbourne Cup? If you want to know what was going on in a particular year, you can browse. In 1932, for example, you will find that the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, Phar Lap died, New South Wales Premier Jack Lang was sacked by the Governor, the ABC was established, the Dog on the Tuckerbox memorial was unveiled, William Dobell painted \"Boy at Basin\", Ion Idriess wrote \"Flynn of the Island\" Ken Hall directed \"On Our Selection\", the basic wage was three pounds three shillings and eleven pence, and over 30 per cent of the workforce was unemployed. \"What Happened When?\" should be a useful reference source for librarians, archivists, reference book collectors and keepers, historians, students, bush lawyers and pub arguers, daily newspaper puzzle solvers, and anyone of the general public interested in Australian history.",
