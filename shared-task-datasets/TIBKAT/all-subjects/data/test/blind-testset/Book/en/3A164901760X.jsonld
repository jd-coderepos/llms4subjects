This book provides a comprehensive overview of the use of ultrasound in the imaging of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract as well as of neoplastic and infectious diseases.   The specific ultrasound features of gastrointestinal disorders are explained, and the value and limits of ultrasound are discussed. Each chapter provides a description of the findings obtained with ultrasound and includes consideration of alternative diagnostic imaging methods for comparative purposes.   Relevant technical developments and applications, such as functional and 3D ultrasound, contrast agents and operative ultrasound, are also discussed.
