                "\"Construction grammar enjoys great popularity among empirical linguists, typologists, psycholinguists, and language educators, because it puts meaning and function of language at the forefront of linguistic analysis. This book shows that construction grammar gives us also a powerful new way to conceive and implement operational parsing and production systems, which could be used as a basic component of a wide range of Artificial Intelligence applications, such as dialog systems, language tutoring applications, or translation assistants. The book focuses on a particular formalism, Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG), that has emerged recently as a solid platform for writing and testing grammars from a constructional point of view. It introduces the basics of FCG and illustrates its use through a number of case studies all centering around the verb phrase. The case studies consider the verb phrase in different languages (Dutch, English, Spanish, Russian) and examine different challenging linguistic phenomena, ranging from word order flexibility, language change, and language acquisition, to the complex semantics of the verb phrase, particularly for aspect. The book is intended for those who want a first contact with FCG and see how different non-trivial analyses of language phenomena can be expressed. It is also an excellent first step for those who want to explore FCG to build language applications. Originally published as special issue of Constructions and Frames 9:2 (2017)\"--"
