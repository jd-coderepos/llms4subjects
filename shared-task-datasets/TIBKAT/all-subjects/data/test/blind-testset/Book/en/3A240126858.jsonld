            "abstract": "The recent trend of participatory approaches presents challenges to those working in the development sector. This work draws together lessons and experiences from key development agencies around the globe on the institutional change needed to make participation a reality. The book explores the main issues and concerns of development professionals involved in PRA practices: adapting PRA methods from micro to macro organizations and the type of changes required by an organization to implement PRA effectively. In addition, the reader is provided with a checklist of practical considerations to guide them through this complex field: training programmes and training needs for all those involved in the participation programme; implementing projects from piloting stages to gradual scaling up; institutional change and the changing cultures and procedures of hierarchical organizations; and participatory monitoring and evaluation. Containing accounts and clear summaries by development workers from a variety of development settings across the globe, this work is intended for development professionals concerned with PRA approaches from field workers to practitioners and policy makers.",
