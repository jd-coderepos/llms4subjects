            "abstract": "Two major projects, Tipperne Bird Sanctuary and Skjern River Pump Stations, illustrated in detail with photos, plans, sections amd line drawings. Tipperne: Includes a watching tower, research center, a bird hide, and a workshop building. The bird watching tower was developed through the synthesis of the open, flat wetland geography and dense moisture in the air, and the techniques of a local factory specialising in the production of masts in solid cylindrical iron bars. The platform provides an elevated framing of the landscape, a space which can be either closed to offer a secluded position for bird counters, or opened-up to the view. The structural system is designed as a jettying frame expanding in width as it rises, allowing a small footprint to incrementally widen to support a larger platform above. 00Skjern River Pump Stations project: As a result of the restoration of the Skjern River basin in 2002, a vast and rich natural area has arisen, becoming an attractive visitor destination. A framework for the new life of the area has been provided with the rebuilding and extension of three pump stations, in the form of exhibition spaces, indoor and outdoor viewpoints to look out over the landscape, rooms for the organisation of events, and better accessibility",
