            "abstract": "\"This is a biography of George Platt Lynes (1907-1955), the gregarious American portrait, dance, fashion, and male nude photographer whose career spanned the late 1920s to his early death. From age 18, Lynes entered the cosmopolitan world of the American expatriate community in Paris when he became acquainted with the salon of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Intending to pursue a writing and small press publishing career, Lynes also began photographing authors like Stein, Jean Cocteau, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Colette. Soon, he turned exclusively to photography, establishing himself as one of the premier fashion photographers in the Cond\u00e9 Nast stable, documenting the ballet companies of George Balanchine/Lincoln Kirstein, and pursuing a private obsession with seductive images of young male nudes rarely published in his lifetime. Lynes's private life was as glamourous and theatrical as his images with their brilliant studio lighting and dramatic Surrealist set-ups. Barely out of his teens, he met publisher Monroe Wheeler who was already in a relationship with emerging expatriate novelist Glenway Wescott. The peripatetic threesome maintained a polyamorous connection that lasted some 15 years. Their New York apartment became a mecca for elegant name-dropping dinner parties. Their m\u00e9nage-a-trois complicates our understanding of the pre-Stonewall gay \"closet.\" This biography, drawing upon intimate letters and an unpublished memoir of Lynes's life by his brother, writer and editor Russell Lynes, paints a portrait of the emerging influence of gays and lesbians across cultural genres that defined transatlantic cosmopolitan culture and presaged later gay political consciousness\"--",
