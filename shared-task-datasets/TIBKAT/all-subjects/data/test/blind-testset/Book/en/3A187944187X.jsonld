            "abstract": "This major reference book has been designed to provide a comprehensive coverage of radical political economy. International in scope, The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy includes contributions from a very wide range of specialists who discuss topics, ideas and theories in the field. Radical political economy is a term used to encompass a range of different schools of thought. These include post Keynesian, Kaleckian, Marxian, Institutionalist, Sraffian and other approaches to economics which share the common theme of production, rather than the exchange focus of neoclassical and Austrian economics. Their concern with the generation and use of the surplus leads them to an interest in dynamics, income distribution, growth and development, and capital accumulation. With over 100 entries, the companion provides detailed information on a wide range of aspects of radical political economy as well as some important insights into its theoretical underpinning. A special feature of the book is its emphasis upon explaining the positive elements in radical political economy. As the first book of its kind devoted to radical political economy, the companion will be an essential reference source for scholars and students with an interest in the development of economic ideas",
