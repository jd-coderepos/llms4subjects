            "abstract": "\"Public in Public History presents international research on the role of the public in public history: the ways people perceive, respond to and influence history-related institutions, events, services and products that deal with the past. The book addresses theoretical reflections on the public, or multiple publics, and their role in public history, and empirical analyses of the publics' active responses to and impact on existing forms of public history. Special attention is also paid to digital public history, which facilitates the double role of the public - as both recipient and creator of public history. With a multinational author team, the book is based on various national, but also international, experiences and academic traditions; each chapter goes beyond national cases to look transnationally. The narratives built around their cases deal with issues such as arranging a museum exhibition, managing a history-related website, analyzing readers' comments or involving non-professional public as oral history researchers. With sections focusing on research, commemorations, museums and the digital world, this is the perfect collection for anyone interested in what the public means in public history\"--",
