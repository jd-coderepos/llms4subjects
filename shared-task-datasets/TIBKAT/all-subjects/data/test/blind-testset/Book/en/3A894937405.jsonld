            "abstract": "\"The Body in Religion: Cross-Cultural Perspectives surveys influential ways in which the body is imagined and deployed in religious practices and beliefs across the globe. Filling the gap for an up-to-date and comparative approach to theories and practices of the body in religion, this book explores the cultural influences on embodiment and their implications for religious institutions and spirituality. Examples are drawn from religions such as Jainism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shintoism, Paganism, Aboriginal, African, and Native American religions, in addition to the five major religions of the world. Topics covered include: - Gender and sexuality - Female modesty and dress codes - Circumcision and menstruation rituals - God language and erotic desire - Death, dying, and burial rites - Disciplining the body through prayer, yoga, and meditation - Feasting and fasting rituals Illustrated throughout with over 60 images, The Body in Religion is designed for course use in religious studies as well as interdisciplinary courses across the humanities and the social sciences. Further online resources include a sample syllabus\"--",
