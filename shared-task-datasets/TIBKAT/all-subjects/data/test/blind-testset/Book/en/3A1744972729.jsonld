                "A high level of employee commitment holds particular value for organizations owing to its impact on organizational effectiveness and employee well-being. This Handbook provides an up-to-date review of theory and research pertaining to employee commitment in the workplace, outlining its value for both employers and employees and identifying key factors in its development, maintenance or decline. Including chapters from leading theorists and researchers from around the world, this Handbook presents cumulated and cutting-edge research exploring what commitment is, the different forms it can take, and how it is distinct from related concepts such as employee engagement, work motivation, embeddedness, the psychological contract, and organizational identification. Examining topics such as high-commitment work systems, work attitudes and motivation, the Handbook provides integration with related literatures. Internationally applicable, sections also discuss the implications of culture differences for commitment and present the latest developments in research methods and analytic techniques that can be used to advance our understanding of commitment. Comprehensive and engaging, the Handbook of Employee Commitment is essential reading for commitment scholars and researchers interested in the latest developments in the field as well as for international scholars who will benefit from its guidance on how to approach research in unique cultures. It will also prove of prime interest to managers and management consultants with its wealth of suggestions to guide evidence-based practice",
