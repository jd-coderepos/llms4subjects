            "abstract": "\"This book is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students as well as more senior researchers, whether experimentalists or theorists, in the fields of surface science, nanoscience and related technologies. Its introductory sections will enable the non-specialist to follow the concepts and applications of the methods described in the book. The advanced researcher will also find much valuable background information and detailed explanations of the various applications of the methods presented in the text. The book can serve as textbook for graduate-level courses of one or two semesters. It covers the theory and practice of surface and nanostructure determination by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD). It is intended to provide a detailed description of the theory including new developments and tested experimental methods, such as for nanoparticles, quasicrystals, thermal parameters, disorder and modulated structures in LEED, and direct methods in SXRD. The focus is on quantitative surface structure determination, while a detailed discussion of the qualitative interpretation of the LEED pattern without quantitative I(V) analysis is also included\"--",
