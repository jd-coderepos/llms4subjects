                "\"Gothic Romanticism relates architecture, politics, and literary form to read afresh the works of the Lake Poets: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. Reading a wide range of canonical and lesser-read texts, including Wordsworth and Coleridge's The Recluse, Wordsworth's The Convention of Cintra, and Southey's Roderick, the Last of the Goths, the book recovers the collaborative project of these poets for a purified \"Gothic\" poetry. The book positions this cultural enterprise in relation to the nineteenth-century Gothic Revival, and argues for a powerful analogy between the Romantic culture of the Gothic and the medievalism of contemporary Anglo-American culture and society\" --Provided by publisher",
