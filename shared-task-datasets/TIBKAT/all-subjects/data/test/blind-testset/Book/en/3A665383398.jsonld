                "\"This book seeks to provide graduate-level and upper-division or honors undergraduate students with a comprehensive understanding of the emerging and rapidly growing field of social entrepreneurship. It is the most complete text on the subject available, exploring both the theory and practice of social entrepreneurship and blending these seamlessly through examples, case studies, the voices of practicing social entrepreneurs, and special features that put students in a position that requires creative thinking and strategic problem solving\"--",
                "\"Social entrepreneurship involves the application of business practices to the pursuit of social and/or environmental mission. It brings the mindset, principles, strategies, tools and techniques of entrepreneurship to the social sector, yielding innovative solutions to the vexing problems facing society  poverty, hunger, inadequate housing and homelessness, unemployment and under-employment, illiteracy, disease, environmental degradation, etc. It finds solutions where government and private sector efforts have not. This intriguing field has captured the imaginations of thousands of business and public administration students around the world, leading to the creation of hundreds of courses and programs of study to meet this burgeoning demand. Yet, there are few, if any, textbooks that offer a comprehensive treatment of this subject. Instructors are forced to cobble together reading materials from multiple sources, creating a hardship for professors and students, alike. This book is aimed at addressing this problem.\"--"
