            "abstract": "This book is a translation of what can arguably be called the very first Arabic feminist manual of the role of women in Muslim socierty by the early twentieth-century Tunisian author and reformist al-\u1e6c\u0101hir/al-\u1e24add\u0101d (Taher Haddad). The extensive introduction places the book in its historical context and includes an overview of the various movements and reformists who dealt with the emancipation of Muslim woman prior to al-\u1e6c\u0101hir/al-\u1e24add\u0101d's book. This is followed by a biography of al-\u1e24add\u0101d and a discussion of the background and genesis of Our Woman in the Shar\u012ba and Society. Causing quite a furore when it was released, the book remains just as topical today as it was then. This book is undoubtedly the single-most original work written on the subject of Muslim woman in the early modern period. It constitutes a major source for a wide readership, which extends far beyond students with an interest in Arabic literature, as it will also be of considerable benefit to anthropogists, cultural and social historians, gender studies specialists, as well as anyone involved in Middle Eastern studies.
