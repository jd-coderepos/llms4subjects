It focuses on the PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) type controller which is the most widely used in industry and systematically analyses several fuzzy PID control systems and adaptive control mechanisms.Foundations of Fuzzy Control 2nd Edition: A Practical Approach sets out practical worked-through problems, examples and case studies to illustrate each type of control system; and is accompanied by a website that hosts downloadable MATLAB programs and a web based course on Fuzzy Control which is taught by the author\"--",
                "\"This new edition covers the basics of fuzzy control and builds a solid foundation for the design of fuzzy controllers, by creating links to established linear and nonlinear control theory. Advanced topics are also introduced and in particular, common sense geometry is emphasised.\""
