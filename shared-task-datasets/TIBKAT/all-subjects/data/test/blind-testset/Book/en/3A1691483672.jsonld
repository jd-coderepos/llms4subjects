            "abstract": "\"From 1914 to 1917 Frank Lloyd Wright developed a system of affordable ready-cut houses for the middle class: the American System-Built Homes. About twenty-five American System-Built Homes of varying sizes and floor plans were constructed before the project stalled due to lumber shortages, as the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Today, only about a dozen of the homes remain standing, including six on Milwaukee's Burnham Street. The Delbert W. Meier House (built in 1917 and named, per the custom with Wright houses, after its original owner) is the only American System-Built Home to have been constructed in Iowa and is one of only eleven Wright buildings in the state. In recent years, Wright's American System-Built Homes have been receiving international press due to the discovery of two previously unidentified models. This book presents the history, construction, and development of this under-explored period of Wright's oeuvre\"--",
