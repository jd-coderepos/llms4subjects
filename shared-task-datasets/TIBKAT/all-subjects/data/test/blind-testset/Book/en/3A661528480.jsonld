                "As the international behaviour of firms changes, so too must the theories used to describe, explain and predict that behaviour change. This volume is conceived as an exploration of the evolving nature of internationalization in the context of shifting environmental forces in an effort to: highlight the nature of firms' changing behaviours; explore the potential reasons for those changes; and propose new perspectives from which a more contemporary theory of internationalization can be developed. The papers in this volume examine the internationalization behaviour of a wide range of firms, from MNCs to SMEs, including firms from both developed and emerging economies. Consideration is given to the rapid internationalization of \"born global\" firms, to inward as well as outward internationalization and to the dynamic nature of internationalization at the beginning of the 21st century",
