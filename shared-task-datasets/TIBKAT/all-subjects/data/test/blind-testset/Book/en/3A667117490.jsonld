                "\"This comprehensive introduction to rock mechanics treats the basics of rock mechanics in a clear and straightforward manner and discusses important design problems in terms of the mechanics of materials. Numerous exercises and examples familiarize the reader with solving basic practical problems in rock mechanics through various design analysis techniques and their applications. A large selection of problems at the end of each chapter are available for home assignment, and a course instructor's solution manual is available for home assignments that may be selected from the extensive list of problems given at the end of each chapter. Explanatory and illustrative in character, this book is an ideal course book in rock mechanics for undergraduate and first year graduate students in mining and civil engineering and a useful introduction to rock mechanics for earth scientists and engineers from other disciplines. In this second edition important design problems are discussed from a mechanics of materials approach. Numerous exercises and examples familiarize the reader with solving practical problems in rock mechanics through various design analysis techniques and their applications.Major applications addressed are:rock slope stability in surface excavations, from planar block and wedge slides to rotational and toppling failuresshaft and tunnel stability, ranging from naturally-supported openings to analysis and design of artificial support and reinforcement systemsentries and pillars in stratified groundthree-dimensional caverns, with emphasis on cable bolting and backfillgeometry and forces of chimney caving, combination support and trough subsidencerock bursts and bumps in underground excavations, with focus on dynamic phenomena and on fast and sometimes catastrophic failures.Supporting the main text, appendices provide supplementary information about rock, joint, and composite properties, rock mass classification schemes, useful formulas, and an extensive literature list.Explanatory and illustrative in character, this book is an ideal text in rock mechanics applications for undergraduate and first year graduate students in mining, geological, and civil engineering and a useful introduction to rock mechanics for earth scientists and engineers from other disciplines\"--",
                "\"The main addition to the second edition is a new chapter \"Bursts and Bumps\" on rock dynamics that has a companion appendix \"Basic Dynamics\" that is a brief exposition of dynamic behaviour of rock. New problems and new examples are also added throughout the text to ehance the existing selections\"--"
