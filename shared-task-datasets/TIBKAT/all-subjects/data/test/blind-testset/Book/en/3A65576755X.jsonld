                "\"While magnetic devices are used in a range of applications, the availability of up-to-date books on magnetic measurements is quite limited. Collecting state-of-the-art knowledge from information scattered throughout the literature, Handbook of Magnetic Measurements covers a wide spectrum of topics pertaining to magnetic measurements. It describes magnetic materials and sensors, the testing of magnetic materials, and applications of magnetic measurements.Suitable for specialists as well as readers with minimal knowledge of magnetic measurements, the book begins with an easy-to-follow introduction to the essentials of magnetic measurements. It then offers a comprehensive review of various modern magnetic materials, such as soft and hard magnetic materials and thin magnetic films. The text also describes all commonly used magnetic field sensors, including inductive, fluxgate, Hall, magnetoresistive, resonance, SQUID, magnetoelastic, and magnetooptical sensors. The final chapters discuss the nondestructive testing of materials and explore applications related to magnetic measurements, including magnetic diagnostics in medicine, magnetoarcheology, and magnetic imaging.A thorough overview of magnetic measurements, this handbook helps readers navigate the sometimes impenetrable terms of the field. It also assists them in the quest to design electromagnetic devices in a more effective way\"--",
                "\"1. Preface This book is a continuation of my previous book titled Principles of Electrical Measurement. But this time the challenge was much more difficult. Electrical measurements are quite well recognized - there are a lot of good literature on the subject. In the case of magnetic measurements the availability of up to date books is limited and in some parts the author had to compile the state-of-the art knowledge from dispersed specialized papers. Of course there are several excellent books and review papers concerning magnetic measurements as such. For many years we had our \"magnetic\" bibles, as for example Ferromagnetism by Bozorth (first published in 1951), Introduction to Magnetic Materials by Cullity (1972 ) or Experimental Methods in Magnetism by Zijlstra (1967). But today these books are reprinted mainly as historical monuments (but also due the lack of more up to date alternatives). Two modern, excellent books on the subject can be recommended as additional readings. These are Measurement and Characterization of Magnetic Materials by Fiorillo and Magnetic Sensors edited by Ripka. But both these books present only relatively narrow part of the wide spectrum of problems related to magnetic measurements. In my University the lecture Magnetic Measurements is not obligatory. And indeed it is very difficult to collect sufficient number of students ready to voluntarily study this subject in more details\"--"
