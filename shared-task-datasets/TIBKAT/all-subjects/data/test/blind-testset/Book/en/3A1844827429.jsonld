            "abstract": "Through a series of highly speculative contributions by both leading and highly acclaimed practitioners and theorists, this book gives a new comprehensive overview of architectures' most recent practical and theoretical developments. While a few chapters are mostly dedicated to a historical analysis of how we got to experience a new technological reality in architecture and beyond, all chapters including the most forward looking, have in common their rigorous understanding of history as a pool of radical experiments, whether one speaks of the history of architecture, or of sociology, technology, and science.   Disruptive Technologies: The Convergence of New Paradigms in Architecture is required reading for anybody student, practitioner, and educator who wants to do serious research in architecture and all disciplines dealing with the shaping of our environment, beyond the important but restricted domain of computational architectural design.
