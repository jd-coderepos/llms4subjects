            "abstract": "\"How to Teach Maths challenges everything you thought you knew about how maths is taught in classrooms. Award-winning author Steve Chinn overviews many of the long-established methods, the beliefs and the culture of maths teaching with a critical eye. Built on his decades of classroom experience and research, he shows how mathematics teaching across the whole ability range can be radically improved by learning from the successful methods and principles used for the bottom quartile of achievers: the outliers. Chinn guides readers through re-adjusting the presentation of maths to learners, considering learners' needs first, and explains the importance of securing early learning to create a conceptual foundation for later success. This highly accessible book uses clear diagrams and examples to support maths teachers through many critical issues, including: The context of maths education today Topics which cause students the most difficulty Effective communication in the mathematics classroom Addressing maths anxiety The perfect resource for maths teachers at all levels, this book is especially useful for those wanting to teach the foundations of mathematics in a developmental way to learners of all ages and abilities. It has the potential to change the way maths is taught forever\"--",
