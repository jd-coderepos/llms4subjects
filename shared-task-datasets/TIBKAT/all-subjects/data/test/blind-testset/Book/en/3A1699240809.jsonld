            "abstract": "\"This edited book examines current methods for the statistical analysis of hypotheses that are compatible with direction dependence. The proposed book is divided in four parts, each consisting of two or more chapters, for a total of 14 chapters. The first part of this book introduces the fundamental concepts of direction dependence in statistical models. The authors provide a historical view on the origins of studying the direction of dependence in a regression line. Various classes of copulas with directional dependence properties are introduced. In addition, an introduction into copula regression functions and concomitants of order statistics in directional dependence modeling is given. Part II of the proposed book is devoted to recent developments and advances in direction dependence modeling of continuous variables and contains six chapters. The author demonstrates the benefits of incorporating concepts of direction dependence to identify causal models. Part III of the proposed volume introduces direction dependence methods for the categorical variable case. Finally, Part IV of the proposed book is devoted to substantive theory and real-world applications and consists of four chapters. The author introduces custom dialogs and macros in SPSS to make direction dependence analysis accessible to applied empirical researchers.\"--",
