                "'Asian-Pacific Rim Logistics presents a wide span of material, geographically and conceptually, in considerable depth. Current conditions are presented with an historical context and up-to-date detail that will satisfy the specialist reader as well as those new to logistics and to Asian conditions. The coverage of logistics and policies within and between Japan, South Korea and China is particularly strong. The examination of developments in global logistics and of conditions in the extended Rim to include Australia and India, provides an interesting base from which to speculate about future directions in logistics.'--Trevor Heaver, University of British Columbia, Canada. 'This book is a tour de force on the dynamic complexities surrounding logistics operations in the Asian-Pacific Rim. Writing in a highly accessible fashion, Professor Rimmer systematically probes those dynamics that mould the complex protocols through the lens of structure and institutions. This is a not-to-miss book for anyone who wants to understand how global flows of goods, finance, information and people are relentlessly reshaped by local policies and logistics practices in countries of the Asian-Pacific region.'--Booi H Kam, RMIT University, Australia. Encompassing China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, extending to Australasia and connecting with South Asia, the Asian-Pacific Rim forms the world's most dynamic economic region. Comprehending the region's logistical structure and its institutions is of pivotal importance for businesses, researchers and policy-makers. The flow of goods, people and information constitutes the global and local economic system. Through a unique analysis of this system and the transport and communications technologies that sustain it, Peter J. Rimmer provides a framework for identifying the multilayered networks and gateways in which the Asian-Pacific Rim's logistics are embedded. Highlighting important structural and institutional features, the role of corporations (money) and states (power) in configuring global and local markets is illustrated by case studies drawn from across the world's major economic regions. This book addresses evolving challenges for policy-makers, arising from the extension of manufacturing and retailing supply chains across national borders, and from globalizing logistics services. By deepening knowledge and viewpoints on these issues, the well-illustrated Asian-Pacific Rim Logistics is essential reading for students expl ..."
