                "Children today are growing up in a culture of confusion and uncertainty. Their lives are often hurried and overcommitted. Structures like bedtime and manners are often not practiced in homes and schools. Parents and teachers are looking for how to teach important skills such as manners and organization to the children in their lives. This book will focus on 14 important skills in the development of children and will offer advice for both parents and teachers on how to successfully teach and model these skills to them. Skills such as teamwork, motivation, resilience, balance, and empathy are presented in each chapter and provide examples for how to use these skills with children. Each chapter begins with an overview, has suggestions for parents and teachers, and wraps up with key points for each of the 14 soft skills presented. The book is practical, and while based in research, is easy to read and comprehend. The guide will help parents and teachers see many ways to teach soft skills, as they will impact children in their future classroom performance, professional demeanor, and various areas that will help them become successful in all areas of life!",
