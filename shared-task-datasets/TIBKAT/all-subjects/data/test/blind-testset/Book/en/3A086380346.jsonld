                "This study departs from the conventional view of the dominance of cavalry in medieval warfare: its objective is to establish the often decisive importance of infantry. In pursuit of evidence, Kelly DeVries examines the role of the infantry, and the nature of infantry tactics, in nineteen battles fought in England and Europe between 1302 and 1347. In these battles, it was infantry forces taking a defensive stand which in most cases won the day. Evidence from first-hand accounts of the battles - a major feature of this study - is employed with rare understanding to argue that victory came not because of superior technology, even when the longbow was used, but due to a solid and disciplined infantry line making a defensive stand able to withstand the attacks of opposing soldiers, whether cavalry or infantry",
                "The battles selected for detailed analysis are: Courtrai, Argues, Mons-en-Pevele, Loudon Hills, Kephissos, Bannockburn, Boroughbridge, Cassel Dupplin Moor, Halidon Hill, Laupen, Morlaix, Staveren, Vottem, Crecy, and Neville's Cross; and the infantry ambushes Morgarten, Auberoche, and La Roche-Derrien"
