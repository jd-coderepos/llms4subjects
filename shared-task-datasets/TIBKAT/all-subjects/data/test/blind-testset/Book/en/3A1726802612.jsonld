                "\"An Integrated Play-Based Curriculum for Young Children, Second Edition explores how to integrate play across the curriculum, helping teachers develop their early childhood curriculum using developmentally and culturally appropriate practice. Distinguished author Olivia N. Saracho offers a theoretical framework for understanding the origins of an early childhood play-based curriculum and illuminates how young children learn and understand concepts in a social and physical environment. This second edition has been fully updated throughout and its comprehensive coverage has been expanded with entirely new sections on technology and social media, cultural differences in play, and teaching ELLs and students with disabilities. Packed with vignettes, activities, and practical examples, this text is essential reading for pre-service teachers seeking appropriate theoretical practices for designing and implementing a play-based curriculum\"--",
