                "'This Handbook helps scholars account for more nuances and complications of the phenomenon of trust. But it is also a firm, intelligent reminder not to mutilate the phenomenon while crafting those accounts.' - Karl E. Weick, Academy of Management Review 'Given the number of special issues and other empirical articles devoted to trust, a handbook to record the state of trust research (both conceptual and empirical) seems timely ... this Handbook provides a collection of essays about different aspects, components, and qualities of trust, as well as differing perspectives on trust ... The editors and authors seem to have delivered on their stated purposes, and the reader can approach the Handbook as a whole, or as separate parts that focus on a particular level of inquiry ... The book is a primary resource for those who conduct trust research.' - Joann Keyton, Academy of Management Review. 'Bachmann and Zaheer's volume is well timed. Along with its valuable inventory of trust research, the Handbook is commendable for representing a true transnational collaboration that brings research from a range of European and North American scholars under one roof.' - Ranjay Gulati, Academy of Management Review. In recent times, research on trust has become a major field in the domain of management and in the social sciences as a whole. The Handbook of Trust Research presents a timely and comprehensive account of the most important work undertaken in this lively and emerging field over the past ten to fifteen years. Presenting a broad range of approaches to issues on trust, the Handbook features 22 articles from a variety of disciplines on the study of trust in both organizational and societal contexts. With contributions from some of the most eminent names in the field of trust research, this international collaboration is an imaginative and informative reference tool to aid research in this engaging area for years to come. The Handbook contributes to an area of key importance to almost every aspect of business and society and, in particular, it will appeal to students and scholars of organization theory, strategy and organizational psychology",
