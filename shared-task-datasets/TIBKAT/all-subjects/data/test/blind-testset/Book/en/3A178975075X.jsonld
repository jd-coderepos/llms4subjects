            "abstract": "\"The British referendum on the membership of the European Union on 23 June 2016 was a cataclysmic event in British and European politics. Years later the consequences are still unknown. This collection seeks to answer the key questions relating to the consequences of Brexit and the future of Britain. Will Brexit affect the British constitution? Is Brexit likely to lead to the breakup of the UK - with Scotland and Northern Ireland seeking independence? How will Covid-19 delay lingering political questions brought on by Brexit? These key questions and more, relating to both domestic and foreign policy, are answered by a range of contributors including expert academics, policy-makers and Members of Parliament and addresses both European and British policy-making.\"--",
