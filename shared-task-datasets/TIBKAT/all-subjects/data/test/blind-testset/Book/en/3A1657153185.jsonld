                "This book analyses the relationship between creative and cultural industries, local economic development and entrepreneurship from a global perspective. In so doing, it investigates the evolving paradigm of creative industries and creative entrepreneurship and their related economy over time. Creative Industries and Entrepreneurship explores cultural and creative economics, management, entrepreneurship, international business, and urban and regional sciences, in both developed and newly emerging countries. The authors provide a framework to understand the evolving paradigm of creative industries and creative entrepreneurship while highlighting the distinction between 'first generation countries' such as the US, Canada, Australia and Europe, and 'second generation countries' in Asia, South America and North Africa. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, the book develops a comprehensive overview of the composite phenomenon of the creative economy and its relationship with entrepreneurship. This inter-disciplinary work will appeal to researchers and scholars interested in creative industries, the creative economy and entrepreneurship, in addition to policy makers and managers within these areas. Readers will find an up-to-date presentation of existing and new research perspectives in these domains"
