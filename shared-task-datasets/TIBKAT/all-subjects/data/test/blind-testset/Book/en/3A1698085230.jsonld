            "abstract": "\"This book delves into the Chinese literary translation landscape over the last century, spanning critical historical periods such as the Cultural Revolution in the greater China region. Contributors from all around the world approach this theme from various angles, providing an overview of translation phenomena at critical historical moments, identifying the trends of translation and publication, uncovering translation norms of important works, elucidating the relationship between translators and other agents, articulating the interaction between texts and readers, and in short, disclosing the nature of literary migration from Chinese into English. This volume aims at benefiting both academics of translation studies from a dominantly Anglophone culture and researchers in the greater China region. Chinese scholars of translation studies will not only find in this volume a dedicated reference book, they will also find the contrast, confluence and communication/conference between the research by local academics and their global colleagues potentially stimulating, inspiring, and ultimately transformative\"--",
