            "abstract": "\"This book offers readers an entirely original and unconventional view of quantum mechanics. It is a view that accepts quantum mechanics as the natural way to think about the way nature works, rather than the view commonly expressed, especially in books on quantum physics, that quantum theory is weird and counterintuitive. It is based on the concept of itemization. From this simple premise, quantities like energy and momentum, both linear and angular emerge naturally, as do configuration space, potentials, the electromagnetic field, many-body dynamics, special relativity and relativistic wave mechanics. The many-body dynamics, because it is not tied to physics from the outset, can be applied to population dynamics outside physics as well as the usual physical situations. From this emerges much of the basic physics that describes, mathematically, how the natural world behaves. This accessible introduction does not require exotic maths, and is aimed at inquisitive physics students and professionals who are interested in exploring unconventional approaches to physics. It may also be of interest to anyone studying quantum information theory or quantum computing\"--",
