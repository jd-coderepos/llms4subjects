            "abstract": [
                "This book explores the bilateral relationship between Brazil and China in modern history, environment, economics, and contemporary Brazilian politics. As China has become Brazil's largest trading partner, importing commodities and exporting manufactures, and a major investor in the country, Brazil's social structure has been upended, with traditional hierarchies jolted and new ones created- in the agribusiness, industry, in the diplomacy of climate change in the Amazon and not least, Brazil's traditional relationship with the United States. In this incisive text, one of Brazil's leading political scientists explores how China, the X factor of international relations, can transform a nation's politics; it will be of interest to economists, scholars of geopolitics, of China's Belt and Road Initiative and of Latin America politics. Mauricio Santoro is Assistant Professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, where he was twice the head of the Department of International Relations. He has written over 40 academic papers/book chapters and the book Ditaduras Contemporaneas and is a frequent contributor to international media outlets such as BBC, Guardian, New York Times, South China Morning Post, Washington Post, Xinhua",
