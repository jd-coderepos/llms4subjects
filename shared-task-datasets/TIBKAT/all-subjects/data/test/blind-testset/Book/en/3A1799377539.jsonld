                "Basics : types of construction--box, shaft, corridor, multi-story types -- Facade construction -- Climatic context and design solution -- Natural ventilation and double skin facade -- Performance analysis and case studies -- Fa\u00e7ade of the future.",
                "\"This book provides a comprehensive theoretical platform for the use and construction of Double Skin Fa\u00e7ade projects. The DSF concept has been used mostly in European buildings however its success in other climates should be addressed. Increasing numbers of buildings are featuring double skin fa\u00e7ade technology in the US, however still relatively few have been studied for their performance in operation. This book gives architects a practical guide to analyze and evaluate the actual performance of double skin fa\u00e7ade buildings in different climatic contexts. For high-performance buildings, it is important to have tools to evaluate a design's predicted performance in order to achieve specific sustainable goals. To determine that the application of DSF in different climates will provide a better thermal comfort, building simulation tools analyze various thermal comfort parameters through studies of the fa\u00e7ade and compare them with the actual building's performance data. The book takes the reader on an on-site tour of eight DSF buildings around the US. Interviews with the buildings' architects and engineers, owners and users offer additional perspectives and insights into the construction and performance of these developments in building design. This will provide architects with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in integrating double skin fa\u00e7ades into their projects\""
