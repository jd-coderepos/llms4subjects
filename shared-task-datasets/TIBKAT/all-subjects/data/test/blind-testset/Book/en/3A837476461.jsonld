            "abstract": "Ernie Rutter has made, and continues to make, a significant impact in the field of rock deformation. He has studied brittle and plastic deformation processes that occur within both the oceanic and continental crust, as well as other key properties such as the permeability and seismic velocities of these rocks. His approach has been one that integrates field observations, laboratory experiments and theoretical analyses. This volume celebrates Ernie's key contribution to rock deformation and structural geology by bringing together a collection of papers that represent this broad approach. The papers within the volume address key issues that remain within these fields. These range from fundamental studies of brittle and plastic behaviour, along with the resultant structures and microstructures from both the field and laboratory, to applied problems where a better understanding of the deformation and properties of the crust is still needed. --",
