            "title": "The globalization of legal education : a critical perspective",
            "abstract": "This book discusses the global and local processes of legal education reform and resistance and explains what these processes mean for law and lawyers inside and outside of the United States. It provides critical insights into how these transnational processes operate in different jurisdictions around the world in light of globalization and local legal structures and hierarchies. It also shows how institutions and practices of legal education have historically moved across jurisdictions and shaped legal education practices transnationally. The impact of European empires, for example, is still very evident in legal reform impacts today. The book analyzes how diffusion relates not only to empires and imperial competition but also in recent decades the rise in power of the United States after the Cold War, including the related diffusion of neoliberal economic policies that have fueled the spread of corporate law firms modeled on the United States and legal education reforms aiming toward the training of corporate lawyers. This new wave of reform is critically examined by focusing on how these global processes intersect with local structures of power. The book recognizes that this power of US approaches was not inevitable and is subject to change as global power, including the rise of China, shifts. What is often portrayed as convergence to \u201cbest practices\u201d in legal education is inseparable from shifting global hierarchies and balances of power.",
