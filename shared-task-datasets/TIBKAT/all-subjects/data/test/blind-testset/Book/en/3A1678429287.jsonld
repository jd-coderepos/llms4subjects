Summary of Sermones Book 1: Horace\u2019s Credentials Containing Political Commentary; Virgil\u2019s Eclogae and Horace\u2019s Sermones Book 1 Compared -- Appendix -- Bibliography -- Index",
                "Horace wrote Sermones book 1 after the death of Julius Caesar when the Republic came to an end, and the transition to the Principate commenced. The book of Sermones.1 is part of Horace's early work and constitutes his credentials for Maecenas, whose circle he joined in 38 B.C. From that time Horace lived in the highly political ambience of the Roman social elite near the centre of power. The focus of the ten poems is on the personal issue of his trustworthiness after his misjudgement in joining Brutus. The volume shows how Horace prepared himself for his future role as a political commentator on contemporary political issues. Weeda\u2019s analysis of the poems from a socio-political angle brings a new perspective on Horace's studies that differs considerably from the earlier literary analyses. Executed in a very consistent manner, this monograph shows through an in-depth interpretation of allusions the probability that Horace wrote each sermo as self-presentation"
