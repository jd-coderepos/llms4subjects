            "abstract": "Distance education has attracted increased attention by educationists as well as by the public in recent years. Because of far-reaching societal changes and spectacular advances of information and communication technology it is presently in an acute process of transition. The author of this book describes and analyses exciting changes and promising innovations which emerge as results of this process. Professor Peters is qualified for examining this subject in a unique way: For ten years he served as Founding Rector of the FernUniversit\u00e4t which is the only single mode distance teaching university in Germany. He visited open universities in many countries of the world. Especially during the last two years he has been able to study the current transition of  distance education in open universities in China, Korea, on the Philippines, in India, Brazil, and Mexico. His previous book 'Learning and teaching in distance education' has been translated into Korean and Portugese. Spanish and Chinese versions are being developed. Experts as well as laymen will profit from reading this new publication as it deals with topical issues of the current development of distance education and online learning. <engl.>",
