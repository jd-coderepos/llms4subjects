                "This book is the first to systematically examine the connection between religion and transitional justice in post-communism. There are four main goals motivating this book: 1) to explain how civil society (groups such as religious denominations) contribute to transitional justice efforts to address and redress past dictatorial repression; 2) to ascertain the impact of state-led reckoning programs on religious communities and their members; 3) to renew the focus on the factors that determine the adoption (or rejection) of efforts to reckon with past human rights abuses in post-communism; and 4) to examine the limitations of enacting specific transitional justice methods, programs and practices in post-communist Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union countries, whose democratization has differed in terms of its nature and pace. Various churches and their relationship with the communist states are covered in the following countries: Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Belarus. Lavinia Stan is Jules Leger Research Chair in Political Science and Coordinator of the Public Policy and Governance Program at St. Francis Xavier University, Canada. A comparative politics specialist, she has done work and published mainly on transitional justice, as well as religion and politics, with a focus on post-communist settings. Some of her most recent publications include (co-edited with Cynthia Horne) Transitional Justice and the Former Soviet Union: Reviewing the Past, Looking toward the Future (2019) and (co-edited with Nadya Nedelsky) Post-Communist Transitional Justice: Lessons from Twenty-Five Years of Experience (2015). Lucian Turcescu is Professor, Graduate Program Director, and past Chair (2011-2016) of the Department of Theological Studies at Concordia University Montreal, Canada. He has done research, published, and taught in several areas, including early Christianity, religion and politics, and ecumenism. Some of his recent publications include (co-edited with L. Stan) Justice, Memory and Redress in Romania (2017), (co-authored with L. Stan) Church, State, and Democracy in Expanding Europe (2011).",
