            "abstract": "'Victor Galaz opens a new pathway, critically needed, yet breathtaking. In a thoughtful and inspirational manner, he takes on the challenge of how humanity is to navigate the unprecedented scale, speed and complexity of the Anthropocene. The focus is on the interplay between rapid nonlinear global environmental change and emerging technologies, like engineering the planet, tipping points, epidemic surprise or increased connectivity between financial markets, commodity markets, ecosystem services and underlying technologies. In a truly novel way, Galaz moves governance research to the very front of sustainability science and resilience thinking 'Global Environmental Governance, Technology and Politics' is indeed a groundbreaking contribution, highly recommended!' (Carl Folke, Stockholm University, Sweden). -- 'The idea of the Anthropocene highlights urgent environmental, health and economic challenges facing humanity. This book shows clearly why shifts in power and governance must be core to our responses, but also that new, creative, multi-scale approaches are needed. Candid, reflective and richly-illustrated, this is a must-read contribution to the debate of our age about how to build sustainable futures.' (Melissa Leach, Institute of Development Studies, Sussex, UK). -- 'The planetary boundaries concept has generated wide discussion and debate, from the research community through to the institution and governance communities that seek to implement the concept. This book fills a very important gap in the discourse. It integrates the basic science that underpins the concept and the innovative approaches that governance researchers and practitioners are applying, to put planetary boundaries into practice. The book's strengths are its excellent description of the science itself, its deft use of that science to inform the development of governance approaches and its application of state-of-the-art research on institutions. I can highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get beyond the often shallow commentary on and criticisms of the planetary boundaries concept to a much deeper, thought-provoking and insightful analysis of how societies can continue to develop and thrive within the planet's safe operating space.'
