                "This volume is divided into four parts. The first Part explores individual philosophers, including Fichte, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, amongst other great thinkers of the period. The second addresses key philosophical movements: Idealism, Romanticism, Neo-Kantianism, and Existentialism. The essays in the third Part engage with different areas of philosophy that received particular attention at this time, including philosophy of nature and of science, philosophy of mind and language, the philosophy of education, and the relationship between philosophy and science, or Wissenschaft (a German term that is famously less narrowly restricted to natural science and disciplines modeled on it than its English counterpart). Finally, the contributors turn to discuss central philosophical topics, from skepticism to materialism, from dialectics to ideas of historical and cultural Otherness, and from the reception of antiquity to atheism",
                "No period of history has been richer in philosophical discoveries than Germany during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. And while it was the eighteenth century that saw Germany attain maturity in the discipline (above all in the works of Immanuel Kant), it was arguably the nineteenth century that bore the greatest philosophical fruits. This Handbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the philosophy of nineteenth-century Germany that will be helpful to readers of very different sorts, all the way from laymen to undergraduates to experts. The volume is divided into four parts. The first Part explores individual philosophers, including Fichte, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, amongst other great thinkers of the period.
