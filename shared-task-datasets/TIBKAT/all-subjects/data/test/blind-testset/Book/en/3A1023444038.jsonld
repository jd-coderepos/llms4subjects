                "'The Research Handbook on Export Marketing provides a wealth of vital knowledge from scholars who are experts in their fields from around the world. The book emphasizes the most topical issues in international marketing today - small and medium enterprises, exporting performance, the services sector, new products, and dynamic capabilities. The articles are well written and informative. The volume makes an excellent contribution to this important literature.'--Gary Knight, Willamette University, US. There has been a proliferation of research published in the area of export marketing in the last four decades. As research output has grown, some previous research has noted that poor conceptualization of performance measures can produce weak theoretical foundations that may eventually become irrelevant in practice. This Handbook aims to inject rigour into this debate and will act as a starting point for future research on export marketing. The Research Handbook on Export Marketing profiles the following main theoretical frameworks used in export marketing: contingency theory; the eclectic paradigm; industrial organization theory; resource-based theories; relational exchange theory; internationalization process theory; network theory; agency theory and transaction cost economics. The different measures of export marketing performance cited in the literature, together with the nature of the relationships between antecedent variables and dependent variables of export marketing performance, are also examined. With expert contributions, this book outlines the development of export marketing theory from its inception to the current day and explores the utility of export marketing theory in assessing export marketing performance. Giving prominence to theoretical approaches in export marketing, this book will provide a necessary reference point for academics and students alike researching export marketing. Practitioners engaged in the pursuit of export management will also benefit from this insight",
