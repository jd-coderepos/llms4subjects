Conducted by Millward Brown, the leading global market research agency, the BRANDchild survey involved several thousand kids from more than 70 cities in 15 countries (throughout Europe, Asia, the United States and South America).

It looks at their life priorities, hopes and dreams and reveals the true drivers of kids' trends by analyzing teen-minority groups, communities and clubs.\" \"Packed with practical advice on how to create kids' brands, including more than 50 fascinating previously unpublished case studies, BRANDchild proposes new innovative ways of marketing to this young audience. It is required reading for anyone wanting a fresh insight into this increasingly influential and demanding consumer group.\"--BOOK JACKET",
