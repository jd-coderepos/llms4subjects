            "abstract": "\"This book is intended for students and graduates of civil engineering, construction management, building and quantity surveying who wish to extend their knowledge and obtain a better understanding of site, business and the corporate management of construction companies. Since its first edition Modern Construction Management has successfully provided a background to how construction companies operate, the management techniques involved, their decision-making and how these decisions are successfully implemented. Over the decades since the first edition the structure of the industry, the techniques adopted and the processes have changed. Whilst the parties to a construction project have remained the same their responsibilities have changed. New materials, technologies and processes have been introduced. However the young construction manager still needs to be a competent technologist to successfully complete construction work as well as possessing the skills of knowledge of management and an understanding of business processes.. This is the basis of career enhancement to executive and board level. This remains the aim of Modern Construction Management\"--",
