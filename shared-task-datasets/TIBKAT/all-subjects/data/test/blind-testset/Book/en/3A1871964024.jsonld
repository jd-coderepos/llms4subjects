                "In today's business landscape, companies compete more and more as integrated supply chains rather than as individual firms. The success of the entire supply chain determines the economic well-being of each company involved. With management attention shifting to supply chains, the role of management accounting naturally must extend to the cross-company layer as well. This book demonstrates how management accounting can make a significant contribution to supply chain success. It targets students who are already familiar with the fundamentals of accounting and want to extend their expertise in the field of cross-company (or network) management accounting. Practitioners will draw valuable insights from the text as well. This second edition includes a new Chapter on Digitalization and Supply Chain Accounting, as well as new opener cases to each chapter that provide real-world examples.
