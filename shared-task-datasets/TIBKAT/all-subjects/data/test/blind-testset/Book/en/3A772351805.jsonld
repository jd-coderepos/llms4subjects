            "abstract": "\"A particulate flow is one in which a moving fluid interacts with a large number of discrete solid particles. The category is extraordinarily broad, encompassing everything from suspended dust carried by atmospheric winds to avalanches of debris or snow rolling down a hillside. Widely varying industrial, biological and environmental processes can be interpreted as particulate flows, encompassing areas of study such as sediment transport by stream and coastal flows, aerosol dynamics, colloidal suspensions, fluidized bed reactors, granular flows, slurries, nanoparticle dispersions, etc. There are also many situations where a suspension of biological cells can be interpreted as a particulate fluid, which extends the notion of particulate flow to problems such as blood flow and algal suspensions. Finally, there are many aspects of the methods used to analyze and model particulate flows that can be either directly applied or applied with small modifications to other types of multiphase flows, including droplet dispersions and bubbly flows, assuming that the deformation of the droplets and bubbles is minimal. Despite the many different forms in which we encounter them, there are a number of characteristics that are shared by most particulate flows. Some of these characteristics arise from the interaction of the individual particles with the surrounding fluid. For instance, a particulate flow past a blunt body tends to exert a higher drag force than the body would experience in the fluid with no particles\"--",
