            "abstract": "\"Molecular landscape for food safety analysis is rapidly revolutionizing because of high resolution and value added resulting analysis of NGS approaches. These modern sequencing technologies drive worldwide advancements in food safety and quality. Sequencing Technologies in Microbial Food Safety and Quality reviews several practices in that NGS contributes to foodborne pathogens functional characterization, management and control. This book focuses on potential uses of sequencing technologies in microbial food safety and quality, also highlighting present challenges in the food industry. This book includes contributions from experts who have manipulated sequencing tools in relation to microbial food safety and quality. Presenting comprehensive details about NGS approaches in food science, this book is an updated and reliable reference for food scientists, nutritionists, food product investigators to study and implement the sequencing technologies for development of quality and safe food. This book would also serve as informative resource for food industry officials, government researchers, food science or food nutrition department students who seek comprehensive knowledge about the role of emerging sequencing technologies in revolutionizing food industry\"--",
