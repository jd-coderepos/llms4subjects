                "\"Nineteenth-Century American Literature in Transition provides an omnibus account of American literature and its ever-evolving field of study. Emphasizing the ways in which American literature has been in transition ever since its founding, this revisionary series examines four phases of American literary history, focusing on the movements, forms, and media that developed from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century. The mutable nature of American literature is explored throughout these volumes, which consider a diverse and dynamic set of authors, texts, and methods. Encompassing the full range of today's literary scholarship, this series is an essential guide to the study of nineteenth-century American literature and culture\"--",
