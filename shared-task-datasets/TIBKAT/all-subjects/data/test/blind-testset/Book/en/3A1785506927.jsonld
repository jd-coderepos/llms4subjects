            "title": "Construction and demolition waste management in Australia",
            "abstract": "\"Due to the increase in construction activities worldwide and in Australia, the generation rate of construction and demolition (C&D) waste has significantly grown in recent years. In Australia, construction projects (i.e. housing, buildings and transport infrastructure) are being delivered at an unprecedented rate. Between 2009 and 2019, the annual average growth rate in this industry was 3.33%. The industry is identified as the fourth largest contributor to Australia's growth domestic product (GDP). Unsurprisingly, this quantity of construction brings about a considerable quantity of waste. In 2019, the construction industry generated 27 million tons (or megatonnes) of waste from construction and demolition activities in Australia. Given the size of the construction market and waste generated in this industry, any change will create huge impacts. The adequate management of such a quantity has now become a priority for policymakers around the world. A holistic national approach is required to handle the growing issue of C&D waste management in Australia. Therefore, this book identifies discrepancies and inconsistencies related to C&D waste management in different Australian jurisdictions. The included chapters discuss regulations governing the C&D waste stream, discrepancies in defining waste, Australia's place in the worldwide C&D waste market, opportunities for reducing C&D waste, and the perception among C&D waste stakeholders on relevant issues and proposed reforms, among other topics. Overall, the book contributes to the Australian understanding of effective management of C&D waste by providing a clear picture of C&D waste state of play. The book can benefit policymakers and whoever is interested in C&D waste to better plan for innovative and efficient C&D waste resulting in the further diversion of C&D waste from landfills\"--",
