            "abstract": "\"Pathogenic fungi cause numerous economic and environmental issues globally that need to be addressed by powerful fungicides. In order to battle the rapidly developing resistant strains of harmful fungus, new fungicide discovery and development is essential. Farmers' increased adoption of bio fungicides would undoubtedly benefit from the emphasis on organic farming as well as residue-free products. The use of fungicides reduces crop productivity because chemically synthesized pesticides are, without a doubt, quick to act, but they also cause numerous environmental and health problems such as the revival of new pests, fungal resistance, loss of soil fertility, and the persistence of toxic substances when consumed by animals and humans. In seventeen chapters, the proposed book discusses the need to develop new antifungals, and improvement of regulations regarding antifungal use. Safe biofungicide-treated crops will acquire additional value since they are devoid of chemical residues, decay, and suspected human-health infections, supporting a global demand of product quality\"--",
