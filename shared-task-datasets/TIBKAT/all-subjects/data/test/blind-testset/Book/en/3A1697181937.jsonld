                "This volume explores the latest advances in high-throughput phenotyping to screen milling quality, cooking and nutritional quality in breeding material, and simplifying grain quality screening in germplasm. The chapters in this book cover topics such as seed development stages; panicle architectural traits to understand yield components; starch structure and protein properties; and genome editing technologies to reveal grain quality and nutritional traits. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Cutting-edge and thorough, Rice Grain Quality: Methods and Protocols is a valuable resource for all researchers interested in expanding their knowledge in this evolving field."
