            "abstract": "\"Provides readers an understanding of the basic physics underlying meta-materials, providing a powerful tool for analyzing their electromagnetic properties Periodic Structures: Mode-Matching Approach and Applications in Electromagnetic Engineering presents the scattering and guiding characteristics of periodic structures using the mode-matching approach and their applications in electromagnetic engineering. The book is structured so that the first three chapters provide an introduction and prepare the reader for chapters 4 to 6, which expand the formulations to electromagnetic and optical structures applicable to practical device applications. The last chapters cover very recent research topics in electromagnetics and optics.  Provides an analytic approach to describing the operation of photonic crystals and related periodic structures  Covers guided and leaky mode propagation in periodic surroundings, from fundamentals to practical device applications   Demostrates formulation of the periodic system and applications to practical electromagnetic/optical devices, even further to metamaterials  Introduces the evolution of periodic structures and their applications in microwave, millimeter wave and THz.  Written by a high-impact author in electromagnetics and optics  Contains mathematical derivations which can be applied directly to MATLAB programs  Ideal for Graduate students and advanced undergraduates in electronic engineering, optics, physics, and applied physics, or researchers working with periodic structures\"--",
