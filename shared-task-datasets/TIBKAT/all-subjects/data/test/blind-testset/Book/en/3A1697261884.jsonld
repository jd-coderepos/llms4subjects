            "abstract": "\"School-Based Consultation and Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder examines the preventive and remedial powers of consultation for indirectly supporting the needs of youth with ASD, through collaborating with their parents and educators. Given the unprecedented numbers of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in schools, and the variety of evidence-based interventions currently available, consultation helps ensure appropriate service delivery across the range of student functioning. Focusing on foundational knowledge and skills that school consultants need to incorporate ASD service delivery into their research and practice, this text addresses consistent and effective service delivery for students with ASD to optimize their positive academic, behavioral, adaptive, and social communicative outcomes. Highlighting relevant cross-cultural research throughout its chapters, the book concludes with a section on future directions in the field that includes areas for improvement in meeting the needs of diverse students, families, and schools\"--",
