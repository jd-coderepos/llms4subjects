This book focuses on sensory characterization of food and non-food products, providing an overview of classical and novel alternative methodologies. A complete description of the methodologies would be provided. Each description would be accompanied by detailed information for their implementation, discussion of examples of applications and case-studies. The implementation of the majority of the methodologies would be performed in the statistical free software R, which would make the book very useful for people non-familiar with complex statistical software\"--",
