                "\"Providing a thorough overview of the political nature of, and dynamics between, the worlds of work, labour and employment, this timely Handbook draws together an interdisciplinary range of top contributors to explore the interdependent relationship between politics and labour, work and employment. Chapters provide a wide range of differing theoretical approaches with which to explore the legal, economic and socio-political aspects of labour, work and employment in pre-capitalist, capitalist and post-capitalist societies. The Handbook explores the purpose, roles, rights and powers of employers and management, workers and unions, states and governments in the age of globalised neo-liberalism. Different non-standard and non-renumerated types of work are examined with their counterparts, offering a thorough insight into the modern economy with a key focus on migration, gender, race and community. An essential reference for political economists as well as business and management scholars, this comprehensive Handbook provides an important analysis of the interconnectedness of politics and labour, work and employment. This will also be a useful read for policy makers looking for broad insights to the ways in which policies can impact labour, work and employment\"--"
