                "\"Formulaic language, sometimes referred to as the phraseology of a language, is increasingly recognised as key to the way language operates. In this volume, the diachronic development of the phraseology of written standard German as used in Switzerland is investigated over the period of the 20th century in order to uncover the motivations of phraseological change. Using data from the Swiss Text Corpus and a novel, data-led method of analysis, it is shown that phraseological phenomena, although diverse, are closely related to social and cultural change in speech community. It is argued that in many cases, the study of changes in phraseology allows for striking and otherwise difficult to obtain insights into the moods of past periods of time. A wealth of evidence and illustrations of these close links between formulaic language and wider culture are discussed, as well as the relative importance of other types of motivation for phraseological change. Implications for the study of formulaic language and of linguistics in general include that an engagement of core linguistic theorising with the historical and the societal context leads to more satisfying models of how language works diachronically as well as synchronically\"--",
