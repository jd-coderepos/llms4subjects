                "Entrepreneurs are, in essence, individuals who take action to convert their ideas into reality. Doing so involves completing many steps; Robert Baron describes these steps, and provides guidance for performing them successfully. To do so, it incorporates several features: the information presented is based on current evidence, rather than 'informal knowledge' or comments of specific entrepreneurs the focus is primarily on the essentials - the issues and topics most central to the field the book does not assume extensive knowledge of basic management disciplines, and so is accessible to readers with a wide range of backgrounds. The practice of entrepreneurship, too, is fully represented, and is emphasized in special sections that highlight what entrepreneurs actually do, or perhaps should do, to attain success",
                "Entrepreneurship: changing the world ... one idea at a time -- Cognitive foundations of entrepreneurship -- Opportunities: their nature, discovery, and creation -- Feasibility analysis ... and other essential information: what entrepreneurs need to know before they begin -- Transforming ideas into reality: careful planning ... and improvising -- Assembling key resources I: obtaining, managing, and using financial assets -- Assembling key resources II: building a strong founding team, developing social networks, and obtaining expert advice -- The central role of entrepreneurs: how their skills, motives, and characteristics shape new venture success -- Legal aspects of new ventures: non-disclosure and non-compete agreements, intellectual property, and franchising -- Managing a new venture: what entrepreneurs should know to do it well -- Building the new venture: strategies for attaining growth -- Endings ... and beginnings: how-and when-entrepreneurs leave the companies they founded"
