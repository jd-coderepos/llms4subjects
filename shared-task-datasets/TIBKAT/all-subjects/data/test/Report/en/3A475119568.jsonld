            "abstract": "Randomness is a powerful tool (instrument) for solving various problems in all areas of computer applications. Randomized algorithms are often more efficient, simpler (and so easier to implement), and surprisingly also more reliable than their best deterministic counterparts. One knows computing tasks whose processing by the fastest known deterministic programs would require billions years of computer work, but randomized algorithms solve them in a few minutes with a negligible error probability below one over the number of seconds since the big bang. How and why is it possible to cause such fascinatingly huge gains ? Introducing the wonderful word of randomness this book does not only systematically teach the paradigmic algorithm design methods such as foiling an adversary, abundance of witnesses, fingerprinting, amplification ,and random sampling, but it also provides a deep insight into the nature of the success of randomization. Taking sufficient space for presenting motivation and for developing reader's intuition, and though being rigor, this text become a \"cheap\" ticket into the exciting area of randomization even for (very) beginners.
