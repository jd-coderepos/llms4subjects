            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The goal of this thesis was the development of photo-crosslinkable model colloids and their application to permanently link transient crystallites and clusters in dispersions of polystyrene microgels. The photo-crosslinking was conducted by a [2+2]-cycloaddition of covalently attached coumarin derivative on the particles\u2019 surfaces. For further analysis of the persistent clusters a technique to produce small, fluorescent microgels was developed.Following other theses of the work-group polystyrene particles were synthesized by emulsion polymerization. These particles were crosslinked to microgels by add-ing 1mol-% of diisopropylene benzene (crosslinking density 1:50). The coumarin derivative and the fluorescent dye were functionalized as methacrylic acid esters to ensure the covalent attachment of the chromophores to the polymer. By employ-ing the seeded growth-method the photocrosslinkable coumarin groups were ex-clusively located on the particles surface. The influence of the solvent on the pho-toreaction and different sources of radiation were investigated in a comparing study. It was found that the photocrosslinking works most efficiently in 1-methyl naphthalene and with a UV-laser (\u03bb = 355 nm). These experimental parameters allowed for photocrosslinking, fluorescent microscopy and light scattering on the same samples",
