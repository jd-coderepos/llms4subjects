            "abstract": "Abstract: Streptomyces from Arnica montana L.: A. montana L., a medicinal plant producing potent sesquiterpene lactones, lives in symbiosis with endophytic Streptomyces strains. Streptomyces is a genus that is known to produce an enormous variety of highly active natural products. The isolated Streptomyces strains revealed to be not yet described species, which have a close relationship to Streptomyces avidinii and Streptomyces spororaveus. In the analyzed Streptomyces extracts, the glutarimide antibiotics cycloheximide and actiphenol as well as the diketopiperazines cyclo-prolyl-valyl, cyclo-prolyl-isoleucyl, cyclo-prolyl-leucyl und cyclo-prolyl-phenylalanyl could be identified. Sesquiterpene lactones were not produced. The extracts showed antifungal and cytotoxic, but no marked antibacterial activity.Birch bark extract and the wound healing process: In the last years, triterpene-enriched preparations from birch bark proved their wound healing promoting effect in clinical studies. The underlying molecular mechanism was further examined in this PhD thesis. An influence of birch bark extract (TE) and the single triterpenes on the actin cytoskeleton of primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts of non-diabetic and diabetic donors could be demonstrated. Mediators which were involved in this reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of keratinocytes were p38-MAP-kinase and PI3-kinase. Additionally, in keratinocytes of diabetic donors a slight activation of p38-MAPK by TE and the triterpene betulin could be observed. The contribution of p38-MAPK in the shape change of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts was also investigated, but no impact could be detected. Further factors, which can exert an influence on the actin cytoskeleton, are the RhoGTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. In keratinocytes from diabetic donors, an activation of all three mentioned RhoGTPases by TE and the triterpenes betulin and lupeol could be shown. Furthermore, in keratinocytes of non-diabetic and diabetic donors an influence on protein expression of several chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, soluble receptors and other factors involved in wound healing could be observed. The most pronounced induction after treatment with betulin was shown for the chemokines IL-8 and RANTES as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine MIF. The theory discussed in literature, that betulin incorporates into the cell membrane and eliminates cholesterol, could not be confirmed. Therefore, the  ...",
