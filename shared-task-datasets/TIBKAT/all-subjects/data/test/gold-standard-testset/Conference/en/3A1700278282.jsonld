It explains how recent research, development, and applications in experimental vibration analysis of civil engineering structures have progressed significantly due to advancements in the fields of sensor and testing technologies, instrumentation, data acquisition systems, computer technology, computational modeling and simulation of large and complex civil infrastructure systems. The book also examines how cutting-edge artificial intelligence and data analytics can be applied to infrastructure systems. Features : Explains how recent technological developments have resulted in addressing the challenge of designing more resilient infrastructure, examines numerous research studies conducted by leading scholars in the field of infrastructure systems and civil engineering, presents the most emergent fields of civil engineering design, such as data analytics and AI for the analysis and performance assessment of infrastructure systems and their resilience, emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to develop the modeling, analysis, and experimental tools for designing more resilient and intelligent infrastructure. Appropriate for practicing engineers and upper-level students, Resilience of civil infrastructure systems : developments in testing, sensing, monitoring, and control serves as a strategic roadmap for further research in the field of vibration testing and instrumentation of infrastructure systems\"--",
