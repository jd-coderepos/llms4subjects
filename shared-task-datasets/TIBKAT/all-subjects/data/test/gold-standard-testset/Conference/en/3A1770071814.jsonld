            "abstract": "This book explores how human factors and ergonomic principles are currently transforming healthcare. It reports on the design of systems and devices used to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, and discusses findings on improving organizational outcomes in the healthcare setting, as well as approaches to analyzing and modeling those work aspects that are unique to healthcare. Based on papers presented at the AHFE 2020 Virtual Conference on Human Factors and Ergonomics in Healthcare and Medical Devices, held on July 16-20, 2020, the book highlights the physical, cognitive and organizational aspects of human factors and ergonomic applications, and shares various perspectives, including those of clinicians, patients, health organizations and insurance providers. Given its scope, the book offers a timely reference guide for researchers involved in the design of medical systems and healthcare professionals managing healthcare settings, as well as healthcare counselors and international health organizations",
