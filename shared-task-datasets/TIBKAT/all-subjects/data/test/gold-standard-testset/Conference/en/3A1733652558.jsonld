                "Technology has been the spark that ignited NATO\u2019s interest and commitment to scientific advancement during its history. Since its creation, the Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme has been instrumental to NATO\u2019s commitment to innovation, science and technological advancement. During the years, SPS has demonstrated a flexible and versatile approach to practical scientific cooperation, and has promoted knowledge-sharing, building capacity, and projected stability outside NATO territory. The priorities addressed by the SPS Programme are aligned with NATO\u2019s strategic objectives, and aim to tackle emerging security challenges that require dynamic adaptation for the prevention and mitigation of risks. By addressing priorities such as advanced technologies, hybrid threats, and counter-terrorism, the Programme deals with new, contemporary challenges. On 17-18 September 2019, the SPS Programme gathered at the KU Leuven University a wide number of researchers from a selection of on-going and recently closed SPS projects in the field of security-related advanced technologies for a \u201cCluster Workshop on Advanced Technologies\u201d. The workshop covered, in particular, the following scientific domains: communication systems, advanced materials, sensors and detectors, and unmanned and autonomous systems. This book provides an overview on how these projects have contributed to the development of new technologies and innovative solutions and recommendations for future actions in the NATO SPS programme."
