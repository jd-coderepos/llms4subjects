                "This book presents the select proceedings of the Indo-Korean workshop on Multi Functional Materials for Extreme Loading, 2021. The book mainly focuses on the very important emerging area of response to extreme loading of composites as well as other materials involving characterization studies, failure mechanisms conditions under quasi static to high strain rates, impact loads, blast loads, crash analysis, and other thermal and fatigue loads. The book also includes other important areas related to special materials and techniques such as 3D printing, nano-composites, multifunctional materials, and high temperature materials. The contents of this book are useful for beginners, industrial designers, academic researchers, and graduate students."
