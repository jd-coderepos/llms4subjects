                "This book mainly focuses on the innovations in intelligent transportation infrastructure and management. The content of the book is selected in such a way that it will cover a wide range of areas to integrate advanced technologies and provide best and innovative solution to problems faced by the rapidly growing transportation sector. The topics of the book primarily address the needs of the students in civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering. It is equally useful as reference material for innovators, inventors, practitioners, and policymaker for an innovative and classified solution in the field of transportation and infrastructure management. Looking at the global electric and hybrid vehicles market, the book focuses on and discuss recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. In this edition, we try to feature toward an update on the performance and costs of batteries which is the current demand of the consumers. The book inspires researchers, innovators, industry experts, and policymakers to consider the solutions into the practice.",
