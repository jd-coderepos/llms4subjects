            "abstract": "This book dives into radio resource allocation optimizations, a research area for wireless communications, in a pragmatic way and not only includes wireless channel conditions but also incorporates the channel in a simple and practical fashion via well-understood equations. Most importantly, the book presents a practical perspective by modeling channel conditions using terrain-aware propagation which narrows the gap between purely theoretical work and that of industry methods. The provided propagation modeling reflects industry grade scenarios for radio environment map and hence makes the channel based resource allocation presented in the book a field-grade view. Also, the book provides large scale simulations that account for realistic locations with terrain conditions that can produce realistic scenarios applicable in the field. Most portions of the book are accompanied with MATLAB code and occasionally MATLAB/Python/C code. The book is intended for graduate students, academics, researchers of resource allocation in mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering departments as well as working professionals/engineers in wireless industry. Presents radio resource allocation optimizations, including wireless channel conditions and incorporating the channel in a simple and practical fashion; Includes a mathematical analysis of resource allocation with a practical industry-like propagation model; Provides an introduction of terrain-based propagation modeling into radio resource allocation optimization.",
