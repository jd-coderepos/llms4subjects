                "\"Effective inventory management can increase revenue, reduce costs, and improve cash flows. Endorsed by Institute of Operations Management and CILT, Inventory Management shows managers how to take control of their inventory system and ensure operations run smoothly. Looking beyond the complexity and theory of inventory management, Geoff Relph and Catherine Milner focus on the most important decisions managers need to make when managing inventory. They examine how inventory management should work, how to control it, and how to balance it, through their use of revolutionary k-curve methodology. They include case studies from various industries, looking at inventory management in diverse areas such as supermarkets and aerospace. The book also includes numerous figures and diagrams as well as valuable online material\"--",
                "\"An organization's inventory budget is a financial amount set by the group's board members.  The decisions of what inventory to have in stock, how much, where, and when, are details handled by the manager.  This book, aimed at practitioners, supply chain managers, and operations and manufacturing professionals, provides a step-by-step approach on how to achieve the crucial link between the budget's decisions and the detail level.  The authors look beyond the theory and focus on the most important decisions managers need to make when managing inventories.  Using case studies from various diverse industries, they examine how inventory management should work, how to control it, and how to balance it\"--"
