                "\"The entire scope of the BioMEMS field at your fingertips. Helping to educate the new generation of engineers and biologists, Introduction to BioMEMS explains how certain problems in biology and medicine benefit from and often require the miniaturization of devices. The book covers the whole breadth of this dynamic field, including classical microfabrication, microfluidics, tissue engineering, cell-based and noncell-based devices, and implantable systems. It focuses on high-impact, creative work encompassing all the scales of life from biomolecules to cells, tissues, and organisms. Brilliant color presentation. Avoiding the overwhelming details found in many engineering and physics texts, this groundbreaking book in color throughout includes only the most essential formulas as well as many noncalculation-based exercises. Important terms are highlighted in bold and defined in a glossary. The text contains more than 400 color figures, most of which are from the original researchers. Coverage of both historical perspectives and the latest developments. Developed from the authors long-running course, this classroom-tested text gives readers a vivid picture of how the field has grown by presenting historical perspectives and a timeline of seminal discoveries. It also describes numerous state-of-the-art biomedical applications that benefit from \"going small,\" including devices that record the electrical activity of brain cells, measure the diffusion of molecules in microfluidic channels, and allow for high-throughput studies of gene expression\"--",

There are numerous biomedical applications that benefit from \"going small\"\"--"
