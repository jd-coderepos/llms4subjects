            "abstract": "Advances in technology and changes in consumer buying patterns have forced businesses to alter their traditional marketing approach to incorporate contemporary ideologies that will drive customer satisfaction, meet societal expectations, and boot business performance for competitive advantage. The unplanned ravaging effects of the covid-19 pandemic, the vulnerability of our planet due to unsustainable living, and the changing digital landscape require that businesses are strategically aligned to these realities in order to adapt and effectively communicate their offerings. The second of this two-volume work examines marketing communications and brand development in an uncertain and changing world. With specific focus on the covid-19 pandemic, social responsibilities, and emerging technologies, this book examines how organisations in emerging economies can effectively engage in marketing communications and brand activity challenges posed by a changing world. Meanwhile, Volume I provides insight into contemporary issues in marketing such as brand avoidance, health and personal branding, and offers a futuristic perspective on marketing communications. Taken together, this two-volume works is a definitive resource for scholars and students or marketing, branding and international business",
