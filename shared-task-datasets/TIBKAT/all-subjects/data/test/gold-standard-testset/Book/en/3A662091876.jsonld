                "\" This thorough, concise, and easy-to-use guide to capturing digital photographs provides an entire step-by-step course for budding digital photographers. All concepts are fully illustrated with sample work by internationally renowned professionals, representing editorial work, photojournalism, and everything in between. Topics covered include essential information for both film and digital photography, such as exposure controls and shutter speed, as well as digital-specific information on image editing, printing methods, and even file storage. The first digital textbook by legendary photography teacher Henry Horenstein, Digital Photography is the best guide yet for aspiring digital photographers, essential both for photographers transitioning from film to digital and those learning the art of photography for the first time. \"--",
                "\"The recent boom in digital camera sales has dramatically revived interest in photography. More people are taking pictures than ever before, from serious hobbyists using digital SLRs to rank amateurs using cell phones. Most photography schools now teach both \"wet\" and digital photography, but many programs are abandoning their darkrooms entirely, requiring students to only use digital cameras. In DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY: A BASIC MANUAL, bestselling author Henry Horenstein provides step-by-step instructions, full-page prints, and line illustrations to illuminate every aspect of digital photography, from exposure controls and shutter speed to image editing, printing methods, and even file storage. Based in the same clear and comprehensive teaching techniques that made Horenstein's Black and White Photography a perennial classic, DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY is essential reading for photo enthusiasts who wish to bridge traditional darkroom technique with the digital present and future\"--"
