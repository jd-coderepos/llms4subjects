                "Although some progress has been made in recent decades in getting women into top positions in government, business and education, there are on-going, persisting challenges with efforts to improve the opportunities for women in leadership. The Handbook of Research on Gender and Leadership comprises the latest research from the world's foremost scholars on women and leadership, exposing problems and offering both theoretical and practical solutions on how to best strengthen the impact of women around the world. The Handbook provides a brief overview of the current state of women in global leadership, explores theories (both established and emerging) focused specifically on women, and examines with both theoretical and empirical research some of the factors that influence women's motivations to lead. The authors delineate some of the most persistent barriers to women's leadership success and conclude with the latest research findings on how to best develop women leaders to improve their status worldwide. The Handbook of Research on Gender and Leadership will appeal to scholars and advanced students in leadership and entrepreneurship. It will be essential reading for leadership coaches, practitioners and business people, particularly those who facilitate leadership programs for women"
