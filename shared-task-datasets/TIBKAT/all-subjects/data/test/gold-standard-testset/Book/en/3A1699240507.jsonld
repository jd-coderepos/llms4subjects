            "abstract": "\"The twenty-four women discussed in these chapters constitute a collective biography that narrates the history of emancipation as experienced by women of African descent in the western hemisphere. As If She Were Free articulates this individual and collective struggle - in which African descended women spoke and acted in ways that declared that they had a right to determine the course of their lives. African descended women sought out freedom from the moment they arrived on the shores of the Americas in the sixteenth century. For the next four centuries, enslaved women measured freedom in degrees, claimed it in stages, and experienced it multidimensional ways. For some women, freedom meant legal protection from slavery, while, for others, something akin to freedom was experienced in the context of a family, a community, or a political association. More than simply deliverance from slavery; emancipation was liberation from civil or other restraints; and it included efforts to gain economic, personal, political, and social rights. On all of these fronts, women emancipated themselves. In telling their stories, As If She Were Free articulates a new feminist history of freedom\"--",
