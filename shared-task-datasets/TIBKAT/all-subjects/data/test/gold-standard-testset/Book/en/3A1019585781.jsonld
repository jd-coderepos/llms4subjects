            "abstract": "In the opening chapter of Gesture Recognition: Performance, Applications and Features, the authors discuss gesture recognition and its role in the developing world of technology. The possibility of implementing a gesture detection application that works with people with special needs is examined, such as recognition of sign language for the hearing-impaired. Following this, the authors present their approach for face detection and tracking, user identification, facial feature extraction and head pose estimation as the low-level representation of facial gesture atomics. Additionally, an approach for a movement-based facial gestures recognition is presented, with results demonstrated through practical approaches. A later work explores spectral features from algebraic graph theory in static hand gesture recognition. Specifically, we apply a technique that uses the elements of the spectral matrix of the Laplacian to construct symmetric polynomials that are permutation invariants. The values of these polynomials can be used as graph features in a statistical learning pipeline that has the ability of distinguishing between distinct graphs and can reveal graph clusters. In the closing study, the authors developed two algorithms for the detection of pointing gestures and one approach for waving on this technological base and studied their functionality. The goal was to determine whether a combination of both strategies improves and stabilizes detection rates--",
