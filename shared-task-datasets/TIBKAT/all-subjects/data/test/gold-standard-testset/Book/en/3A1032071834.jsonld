                "The last two centuries have seen extraordinary technological and economic advances. This growth has come at a cost - that of a rapidly degrading environment. Pollution, resource depletion, and climate change threaten human civilization. The current governance structures do too little too slow. In a planet with finite resources, this is not sustainable. We must act and act now to avert a catastrophe waiting to happen. But where do we start? 'Sustainability models for a better world' gives simple and elegant answers. Illustrative models form the basis of its 55 chapters. Each chapter only 3-4 pages in length, written in newspaper or magazine style language, this book will help to understand sustainability, plan action, implement, monitor progress and continue best practices. A simple approach in five steps will make things happen: 1. create a working model to understand and internalize sustainability; 2. break up big problems into smaller contributory causes and work back for solutions; 3. go for progressive risk reduction and resilience enhancement; 4. monitor change and be mindful of planetary limits; and 5. replicate best practices to promote green growth. The sustainability paradigm and its pathway, sustainable development, are more than the environment, it involves the economy and society. We need to maintain this balance. The ability to sustain stability seems to define sustainability. The book is written for a broad audience: students, teachers, universities, civil society, governments and quasi government organizations",
