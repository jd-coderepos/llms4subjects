While famous for his sculptural and bold architecture, such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri and the TWA Terminal at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Eero Saarinen: Furniture for Everyman is the first monograph to focus exclusively on his furniture designs. A self-declared \"form-giver,\" his furniture, like his architecture, is characterized by its sleek and expressive forms.  Taken into production by the furniture company Knoll, which was co-owned by his friend Florence Knoll, Saarinen's designs were trend-setting and revolutionary. As many of them continue to be produced today, such as the well-known and loved Womb chair and his Pedestal Collection, they are ubiquitous. Featuring rare and never-before-seen archival photographs that span Saarinen's technical work to his personal life, a preface by Florence Knoll, and a piece by designer and Saarinen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Niels Diffrient, Eero Saarinen: Furniture for Everyman is the authoritative and comprehensive guide to the furniture designs and legacy of the modern master \"-- Publisher's web site",
