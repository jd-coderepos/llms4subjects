            "abstract": "This book covers a lot of ground in contemporary macroeconomics, from fundamental theories such as market structures and equilibrium to emerging concepts that reflect the most critical challenges of modern times, including economic slowdowns, the resilience of public health systems, digitalization, environmental footprints, and many more. The COVID-19 outbreak has aggravated the recurrent problems of poverty and income inequality between countries, food insecurity and hunger, unemployment, and social disorders that have resulted in the exacerbation of political, economic, and trade tensions between countries. In view of the damaging consequences of the pandemic for the entire global economy, the book examines how existing macroeconomic tools and policies could be adapted to the new normal to ensure sustainable post-pandemic development and growth. The main text is interspersed with real-life illustrations and cases that demonstrate practical implications of the concepts under study. This makes the reading relevant and active. Every chapter starts with learning objectives and ends with a series of questions and quizzes that enable easier reinforcement of the course content. This book is written mainly for students, but it would be much useful to the broader public audience, including postgraduates, researchers, and business people who will be able to learn all recent updates about macroeconomics and the post-pandemic perspectives of the global economy.",
