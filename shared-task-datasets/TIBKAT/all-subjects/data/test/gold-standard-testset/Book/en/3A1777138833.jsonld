            "abstract": "Smart Technologies and Design for Healthy Built Environment connects smart technology to a healthy built environment that builds upon the sustainable building movement. It provides an overall summary of the state-of-the-art technologies that are applied in the built environment. The book covers a broad spectrum of smart technology categories ranging from dynamic operability, energy efficiency, self-regulating and self-learning systems, and responsive systems. The foreseeable challenges that are associated with smart technologies are discussed and outlined in the book. Firstly, this book provides a snapshot of state-of-the-art smart technologies being applied in the built environment. It covers a broad spectrum of smart technology categories, ranging from dynamic operability, energy efficiency, self-regulating and self-learning systems, to responsive systems. Secondly, this book provides in-depth analysis of the four primary components of health (biological, physical, physiological and psychological); their effects on wellbeing and cognitive performance are introduced as well. Thirdly, it connects smart technologies to those health-influencing factors by reviewing three completed smart building projects. This book can also serve as a basis for education and discussion among professionals and students of diverse backgrounds who are interested in smart technologies, smart building, and healthy building. Smart Technologies and Design for Healthy Built Environment serves as the basis for education and discussions among professionals and students who are interested in smart technologies, smart building and healthy building, as it bridges the gap between smart technologies and a healthy built environment. The book also provides a foundation for anyone who is interested in the impact of smart technology on the health of built environment",
