            "abstract": "\"This volume, Temperate Fruits: Production, Processing, and Marketing, presents the latest pomological research on the production, postharvest handling, processing and storage, and information on marketing for a selection of temperate fruits. These include apple, pear, quince, peach, plum, sweet cherry, kiwifruit, strawberry, mulberry, and chestnut. With chapters from fruit experts from different countries of the world, the book provides the latest information on the effect of climate change on fruit production, organic fruit growing and advanced fruit breeding, the nutraceutical value and bioactive compounds in fruits and their role in human health, and new and advanced methods of fruit production. Topics include microirrigation, sustainable nutrient management, crop protection and plant heath management, and farm mechanization. The volume considers crop diversity, species variability and conservation strategies, production technology, plant architecture management, plant propagation and nutrition management, organic farming, dynamics in breeding and marketing of fruit crops, postharvest management and processed food production of fruit crops, and crop protection and plant health management. The book looks at the advancements in agro-techniques, timely harvests, and proper postharvest handling and care that have paved the way for enhanced market share of fruit crops. It also considers the extreme challenges of climate vagaries, erratic rainfall, drought, rapid urbanization, particularly in South Asia, that have affected the major fruit-producing belt, as well as other challenges, such as land degradation, long-term use of inorganic inputs, land fertility depletion, vulnerabilities of pest and diseases and more. This volume provides a wealth of diversified and contemporary information on temperate fruit and will be valuable for those involved in research and industry in temperate fruit production, processing, and marketing\"--",
