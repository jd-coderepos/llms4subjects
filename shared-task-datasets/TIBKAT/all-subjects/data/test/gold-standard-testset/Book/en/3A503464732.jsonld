                "This unique book looks at a cost-efficient, fast and accurate means of facial reconstruction - from segmented, decomposed, or skeletal remains - using computer-graphic and computational means. \"Computer-Graphic Facial Reconstruction\" is designed as a valuable resource for those scientists designing new research projects and protocols, as well as a practical handbook of methods and techniques for medico-legal practitioners who actually identify the faceless victims of crime. It looks at a variety of approaches: artificial intelligence using neural networks, case-based reasoning, Baysian belief systems, along with a variety of imaging methods: radiological, CT, MRI and the use of imaging devices. The methods described in this book complement, or may even replace, the less-reliable, more traditional means of securing identification by presumptive means, i.e., recognition of clothing, personal effects and clay reconstruction.",
