            "abstract": "\"When Philip Johnson died in 2005 at the age of 98, he was still one of the most recognizable\u2013and influential\u2013figures on the American cultural landscape. The first recipient of the Pritzker Prize and MoMA\u2019s founding architectural curator, Johnson made his mark as one of America\u2019s leading architects with his famous Glass House in New Caanan, CT, and his controversial AT&T Building in NYC, among many others in nearly every city in the country\u2013but his most natural role was as a consummate power broker and shaper of public opinion. Johnson introduced European modernism\u2013the sleek, glass-and-steel architecture that now dominates our cities\u2013to America, and mentored generations of architects, designers, and artists to follow. He defined the era of \u201cstarchitecture\u201d with its flamboyant buildings and celebrity designers who esteemed aesthetics and style above all other concerns. But Johnson was also a man of deep paradoxes: he was a Nazi sympathizer, a designer of synagogues, an enfant terrible into his old age, a populist, and a snob. His clients ranged from the Rockefellers to televangelists to Donald Trump. Award-winning architectural critic and biographer Mark Lamster\u2019s THE MAN IN THE GLASS HOUSE lifts the veil on Johnson\u2019s controversial and endlessly contradictory life to tell the story of a charming yet deeply flawed man. A rollercoaster tale of the perils of wealth, privilege, and ambition, this book probes the dynamics of American culture that made him so powerful, and tells the story of the built environment in modern America.\"--",
