                "\"The second edition of Plant Pathology: Techniques and Protocols covers diagnostic methods that are currently used in laboratories for a broad range of plant species and matrixes. These include serological and molecular methods that have one or more of the following characteristics: suitability for high-throughput testing, detection of a group of pathogens or of sometimes uncharacterized pathogens, detection and identification of specific pathogens, and high sensitivity. This volume discusses qualitative and quantitative tests, as well as recently developed diagnostic methods. It also provides background information on many pathogens, which are either endemic, non-endemic, or emerging and with different lifecycles that cause diseases of significant importance in a wide variety of hosts. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, background information on pathogens and the disease caused, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Informative and cutting-edge, Plant Pathology: Techniques and Protocols, Second Edition is the perfect book for plant pathologists and molecular biologists who will use this information to test out the latest research in their laboratories.\"--Back cover"
