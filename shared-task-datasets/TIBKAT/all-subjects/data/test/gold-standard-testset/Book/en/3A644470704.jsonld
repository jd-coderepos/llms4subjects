                "\"Norbert Elias has been increasingly recognised as one of the most important sociologists of the twentieth century and, moreover, one whose writings retain their significance and relevance for the twenty-first century. Although there are some important parts of the globe - most notably the USA - where sociologists still know relatively little about him, there are now energetic research networks using his ideas in every continent. This monograph provides a unique perspective on Elias's thought. It includes a comprehensive background to his writing, an analysis of its theoretical and substantive influence upon the sociological tradition, an exploration of the international dimensions and multi-disciplinary aspects of his work, and a selection of some of the most exciting empirical research that is presently being conducted using what has become known as 'figurational sociology'\"--",
