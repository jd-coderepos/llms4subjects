            "abstract": "More Thinking Through Geography is another resource for geography teachers at secondary level to create lessons led by geography thinking skills. This geography resource provides more thinking skills activities to help teachers integrate transferable learning skills into their teaching of geography. From the same stable as Thinking Through Geography, this title, like its predecessor, maintains a direct focus on students\u2019 learning and promotes teaching thinking. More Thinking Through Geography contains eight strategies to enable teachers to further diversify their catalogue of teaching approaches and endorses the importance of teachers engaging in their own professional development to learn why these approaches encourage thinking. The book has 12 clearly structured chapters, four of which give advice on how to integrate the strategies within the curriculum, use the strategies as part of an assessment scheme, integrate thinking skills into department development plans and explain how to develop effective debriefing skills. Consideration has also been given to adapting methods to suit different ability and age groups.",
