            "abstract": "Acclaim for the first edition: 'Professor Brent's book is a superb and much-needed text in the field of health care evaluation. The economic approaches for appraisal of health care programs are presented with greater clarity than any other available text. A comprehensive review of cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-benefit analysis is given in a simple and yet very insightful manner that pointedly demonstrates their fundamental principles, methodological requirements, and common linkages for evaluation research. The book skilfully merges theory and application of the economic analyses of health care, combining the latest literature with adroit illustrations of required methodologies and easily understandable examples that inform the reader of how empirical evaluation research should be conducted. Major evaluation concerns about the appropriateness of discounting health benefits, the appropriate discount (interest) rate, and intangible benefits and costs are critically appraised. Not only is the criterion of economic efficiency of health care programs explored directly and with lucidity, but the important social question of the equity of health interventions is also assessed straightforwardly. Students of health care as well as health policy analysts and administrators are provided with a considerable solid foundation for undertaking evaluation of complex health care issues. In short, Professor Brent has even made the economics of health care evaluation accessible to non-economists in the health care field.' (Paul L. Solano, University of Delaware, US). -- Cost-benefit analysis is the only method of economic evaluation that can effectively indicate whether a health care treatment or intervention is worthwhile. In this thoroughly updated and revised second edition, Robert Brent expands the scope of the field by including the latest concepts and applications throughout all regions of the world. This book attempts to strengthen the link between cost-benefit analysis and the mainstream health care evaluation field, which is dominated by non-economists. The need to build a bridge between the two is more important than ever before, as the general understanding of cost-benefit analysis appears to have regressed.",
