            "abstract": "\"Food products are made by combining food ingredients in specific proportions in a formulation. Research on the effects of various formulations and processes on product qualities is common. However, research is focussed on either the effect of formulation or a novel processing technique on the product characteristics. A comprehensive document understanding the two-way trends in food formulation, its effect on commercialisation of new technologies and impact of new technologies on formulations is not currently unavailable. There are many novel food ingredients and emerging technologies available to process formulations, but optimization of the formulation and manufacturing process are still required. Therefore, novel and healthy ingredients along with increasing requirement of novel processing techniques for clean label food products as well as regulations and legislation to their use formed the premise of this book. There is thus a need to document not only the food ingredients and formulations, but also to know how novel processes that can be exploited industrially\"--",
