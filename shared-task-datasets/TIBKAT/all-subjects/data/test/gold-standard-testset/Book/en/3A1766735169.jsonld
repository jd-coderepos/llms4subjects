                "Globally stone fruits are emerging in the market due to the increased consumer\u2019s desire for health-promoting foods. Stone fruits attract research attention, mainly due to the cultural and commercial aspects of the array of varieties that are grown. Being grown in wide range of environments, it is very important to understand what factors influence the production and quality attributes of stone fruits. There is a lack of systematic scientific information on strategic approach for production technologies of such fruits. This book will be first of its kind focusing on technological aspects of stone fruits especially on latest developments in present day horticulture. It will be an essential reference for professionals including academicians, scholars, researchers and industries working in the said area. We hope that readers will find this book a useful resource for their research or studies, and it will be helpful in the development of high quality stone fruits in future which will improve the economic and social life of people. Besides, this book fulfills the needs of a number of horticultural courses of Universities and will serving as a pomological manual for all occasions.",
