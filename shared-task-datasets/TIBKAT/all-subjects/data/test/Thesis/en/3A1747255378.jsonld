            "abstract": "Contrary to what was long assumed, church building was by no means meaningless during National Socialism. On the contrary, church building activity was considerable. For the first time, the author provides evidence of more than 800 sacred buildings erected at that time in the territory of today's Federal Republic of Germany alone.Her work, which is based on the analysis of numerous examples, is devoted to church building, church art and church transformations in the years between 1933 and 1945. She works out that the architectural styles that were dominant at the time also had an impact in church building. In church art, Christian motifs often have a heroic and, in some cases, an emphatically ideological character. Subjects of Nazi propaganda also made their way into the church interiors - even Nazi symbols and Hitler portraits were not taboo. Beate Rossi\u00e9 also directs her attention to the historical background of church building projects and designs. It sheds light on the political context of the time, the authors and the sponsors, which also included state institutions, the respective environment, the urban planning embedding and biographical aspects. The focus of their study is Berlin. In addition, examples from other regions are used",
