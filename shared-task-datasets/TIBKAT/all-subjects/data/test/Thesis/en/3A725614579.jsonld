            "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The return of large carnivores to the densely populated cultural landscapes of Central Europe represents a major challenge for conservation management. Particularly for the establishment of new populations - through immigration or active reintroduction - human-induced mortality like vehicle collisions or poaching are factors of major concern. This interdisciplinary thesis investigates the key factors for long-term survival and a successful management of lynx (Lynx lynx) by integrating natural scientific and social scientific analyses. The natural scientific part encompassed the analysis of habitat suitability, road mortality and population survival. Models were calibrated using data from the lynx population in the Swiss Jura Mountains and were extrapolated to Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (BW), Germany, with no current presence of lynx. The social scientific part of the analysis addressed the motivation of hunters for poaching, and was carried out for Germany.   Using a logistic regression of telemetry data from lynx in the Swiss Jura Mountains 11 habitat-related variables could be identified which significantly influence the animals\u2019 spatial distribution pattern. Besides slope and human land use, particularly aspect and the distance to roads had the greatest impact on the habitat selection of lynx. Applying the model to BW it could be shown that 10 % of the area is suitable for lynx, which would give room to a population of 108 resident individuals. The most important regions for the establishment of a population are the Black Forest (71 animals) and the Swabian Alb (27 animals).  To investigate the specific risk of road sections for lynx, the location of 39 road kills in Switzerland were analysed using logistic regression. Road category, habitat suitability for lynx within 400 meters to both sides of the roads and the distance to urban areas were shown to have a significant effect on the risk of road kills",
