            "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the synthesis of novel functional materials based on plasmonic nanoparticles. Three systems with targeted surface modification and functionalization have been designed and synthesized, involving modified perylenediimide doped silica-coated silver nanowires, polydopamine or TiO2 coated gold-palladium nanorods and thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-SH)/dodecanethiol (DDT) modified silver nanospheres. Their possible applications as plasmonic resonators, chiral sensors as well as photo-catalysts have been studied. In addition, the interaction between silver nanospheres and 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) molecules has also been investigated in detail. In the first part of the thesis, surface modification on Ag nanowires (NWs) with optimized silica coating through a modified St\u00f6ber method has been firstly conducted, employing sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to replace ammonia solution (NH4OH). The coated silver nanowires with a smooth silica shell have been investigated by single-particle dark-field scattering spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron-energy loss spectroscopy to characterize the morphologies and structural components. The silica-coated silver nanowires can be further functionalized with fluorescent molecules in the silica shell via a facile one-step coating method. The as-synthesized nanowire is further coupled with a gold nanosphere by spin-coating for the application of the sub-diffractional chiral sensor for the first time. [...]",
