            "abstract": "The cumulative thesis is based on 21 publications and describes different aspects of the glass structure in very different glass systems. The role of conventional glass formers, such as SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 is discussed for changes in the coordination, changes in the fraction of bridging and non-bridging oxygen ions, and in regard to the interconnectivity of multicomponent systems. The impact of various modifier cations, which by themselves do not form glasses, on the basic glass network is discussed; as is the contribution these cations have on the network stability through cross-linking. The thesis compares the full concentration range of modifier ions in glasses; starting from very low dopant concentrations, where dopants act as probe ions or as active coloring or luminescing agents, to higher concentrations where preferential bonding and clustering of these ions impacts the glass structure, all the way to even higher concentrations where cation oxides are an integral part of the glass structure and thus fundamental constituents of the glass itself. Optical (absorption or photo-luminescence) and ESR spectroscopy can be used in the identification of the oxidation state and coordination of transition metal ions in glasses. Preferential bonding of dopants or of certain glass modifier cations is studied, as is preferential bonding between conventional network formers. Raman, IR and NMR spectroscopies in the low alkali borosilicate system show for example preferential bonding between tetrahedral borate units to borate entities (tetrahedral or trigonal) rather than to silicate tetrahedra. Modifications of the glass structure depending on the thermal history of a sample, after external impact such as irradiation, laser modification or indentation are discussed, as are surface modifications of archaeological glass samples from the late bronze age.",
