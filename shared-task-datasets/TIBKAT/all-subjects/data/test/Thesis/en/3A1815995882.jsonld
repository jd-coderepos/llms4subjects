            "abstract": "In this thesis, we were interested in studying the deposition of layers formed by stimuli-responsive colloidal soft particles using a surface acoustic wave method: \u201cQuartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring, (QCM-D)\u201d. This thesis is divided into four chapters: chapter 1 gives an introduction to the structural properties of polymers and glasses in solution and at interfaces, chapter 2 presents the principles of the QCM-D monitoring technique in terms of the physical meaning of its main output (the normalized resonance frequency shift \u0394fn/n and dissipation factor shift \u0394Dn) and important parameters to consider while carrying out our study (temperature and light control). Chapter 3 is dedicated to deposition control of soft layers formed out of dual stimuli-responsive colloidal particles of Poly (triethylene glycol acrylate-co-Spiropyran acrylate) (P(TEGA-co-SPA)). In this chapter, we examine the concomitant effect of light and temperature in order to manipulate the formation process of soft glassy films and their subsequent structural response. Chapter 4 presents the kinetics of the deposition of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) P(NIPAAm) soft glassy layers. In this chapter, we focus on the effect of temperature and concentration on the isothermal glass formation below and above the phase separation temperature using a twostep kinetic model. We also provide a subsequent analysis of the viscoelastic properties of the deposited layers in non-isothermal mode and compare it with their properties in isothermal mode. The present study extends the state of the art in two main disciplines. The first discipline is fundamental research in glass sciences and the second discipline is the research of multi stimuli-responsive polymers, where our findings would be of great interest for applications that need remote-controlled switching, especially in microfluidic chips and biomedical applications.",
