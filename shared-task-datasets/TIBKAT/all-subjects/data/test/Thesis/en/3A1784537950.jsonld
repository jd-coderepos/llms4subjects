            "abstract": "Understanding processes on sub-micron scales that are obscured from the observer\u2019s naked eye represents a long cherished desire of mankind. Unfortunately, single particle studies are time demanding and suffer from Brownian motion, which thus limits their practicability and range of applications. Optical and electrical trapping, however, both awarded with a Nobel prize, represent two sophisticated and widely applied solutions allowing for controlled access to individual particles via almost the entire room angle. Particle trapping via optical fibers in principle provides a flexible and low-cost photonic platform enabling remotely operable applications within difficult to reach environments, including in situ and in vivo scenarios. The microtechnologically functionalized tip of a hybrid optical fiber (HOF), in particular, which in contrast to conventional optical fibers incorporates additional materials, offers a unique platform for implementing electromagnetic, i.e., optical and electrical, fields that are essentially required for the trapping of particles and unavailable by standard fibers alone. Within the scope of this work, three unique implementations of HOF tip-based particle traps, which in detail rely on integrating a liquid channel, a pure silica section and metallic wires for functionalizing the fibers, are demonstrated, discussed, and compared to state-of-the-art concepts. First, the principles of optical phenomena, the motion of microscopic objects and influences of confinements including different particle trapping mechanisms, as well as required methods for analyzing and characterizing fiber-based particle traps are introduced. Subsequently, three unique concepts, which in detail consist of a dual fiber focus trap, a single meta-fiber trap and a fiber point Paul trap, and effectively represent two optical and one electrical trap, are discussed and compared with respect to current implementations. ...",
