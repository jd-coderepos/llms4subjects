            "title": "How does adhesion influence the small aggregates in Saturn's rings",
            "abstract": "Particles in Saturn\u2019s main rings range in size from dust to even kilometer-sized objects. Their size distribution is thought to be a result of competing accretion and fragmentation processes. While growth is naturally limited in tidal environments, frequent collisions among these objects may contribute to both accretion and fragmentation. As ring particles are primarily made of water ice attractive surface forces like adhesion could significantly influence these processes, finally determining the resulting size distribution. Here, we derive analytic expressions for the specific self-energy Q and related specific break-up energy Q\u22c6 of aggregates. These expressions can be used for any aggregate type composed of monomeric constituents. We compare these expressions to numerical experiments where we create aggregates of various types including: regular packings like the face-centered cubic (fcc), Ballistic Particle Cluster Aggregates (BPCA), and modified BPCAs including e.g. different constituent size distributions. We show that accounting for attractive surface forces such as adhesion a simple approach is able to: a) generally account for the size dependence of the specific break-up energy for fragmentation to occur reported in the literature, namely the division into \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cgravity\u201d regimes, and b) estimate the maximum aggregate size in a collisional ensemble to be on the order of a few meters, consistent with the maximum aggregate size observed in Saturn\u2019s rings of about 10m",
