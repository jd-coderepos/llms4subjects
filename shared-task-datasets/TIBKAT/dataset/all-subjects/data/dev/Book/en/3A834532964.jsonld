                "\"Hyperspectral imaging, as an emerging technology, acquires and analyzes a large amount of spectral and spatial information from a real scene in the form of three-dimensional images. The technology offers unprecedented capabilities, compared to conventional imaging and spectroscopy, for a wide range of applications from satellite remote sensing to biomedical imaging and to product quality and safety inspection. Image processing and analysis is thus at the core of the technology. With rapid developments both in hardware and software in recent years and increased demands for better quality and safer food products, we have witnessed expanding R&D activities and applications of hyperspectral imaging technology in objective, rapid, non-destructive and automated safety inspection and quality control for a variety of food and agricultural products and production. Hyperspectral Imaging Technology in Food and Agriculture is focused on major recent advances in research and applications of hyperspectral imaging technology in food and agriculture. The book begins with the fundamentals of the technology, followed by a comprehensive coverage of food quality and safety evaluation in meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and other foods, as well as remote sensing for crop production. This book is written by international peers who have academic and professional credentials, with each chapter addressing a particular topic or specific application of the technology. The book provides the engineer and technologist working in the food and agricultural industry with critical, comprehensive and readily accessible information on hyperspectral imaging technology. It also serves as an essential reference source to undergraduate and postgraduate students and researchers in universities and research institutions\"--Back cover"
