            "title": "Rotary nonresonant energy harvesting",
            "abstract": "Abstract: The aim of this dissertation was to develop a system for a nonresonant rotary energy harvester, which converts a fraction of rotational mechanical energy into electrical energy. With this energy, won from an extremely wide range of mechanical rotational speeds (from a few hundredths to 6000 revolutions per minute), an absolute rotary encoder is powered, which can work autarkic. In doing so, attention was also paid to build robust numerical models, which could be applied on realized prototypes. The goal was to build a simple and robust energy harvester, which can be used in the industry (for rotary encoders, door latches, etc.). There are several harvester techniques suitable for such a project, such as piezoelectrical, giant Barkhausen effect (Wiegand wires) or the electromagnetic induction principle and even a combination of several techniques can be envisaged for this purpose. These physical effects might be coupled with a mechanical nonlinear system to convert (abruptly) smallest amounts of stored mechanical energy into electrical energy. On the basis of prototypes, it was investigated which energy harvester methods are suitable.<br>Key results of this developed electromagnetic transducer system are the following ones: a rotary harvester that produces for one half-revolution an electrical peak power of 120mW when a brake torque of 70mNm is applied on the shaft. An electrical management system is conditioning the electrical power for an attached microcontroller system counting half revolutions and writing this counter-value subsequently into a non-volatile memory. In addition, a signal conditioning circuit was developed for direction detection to count reliable half revolutions in clockwise and counter clockwise direction.<br>In the course of this dissertation, investigations were not only focused on pure rotatory but also on translatory applications, which are based on very similar mathematical models. A new generation of a basepoint-excited Kinetic Energy Harvester (KEH) system has been proposed that utilizes parametric and autoparametric resonances for harvesting from environmental vibrations giving a wider frequency bandwidth than classical nonlinear systems with only one degree of freedom",
