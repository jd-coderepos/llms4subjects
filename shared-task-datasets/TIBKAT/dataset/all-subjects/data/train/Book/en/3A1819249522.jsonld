            "abstract": "\"The rapid growth and expansion of the chemical process industry during the past century have been accompanied by a simultaneous rise in human health problems as well as material and property losses because of fires, explosions, hazardous and toxic spills, equipment failures, other accidents, and business interruptions. Concern over the potential consequences of emissions of harmful chemicals (along with catastrophic accidents) has sparked interest at both the industrial and regulatory levels in obtaining a better understanding of the potential for environmental health risks in chemical and related industries. This practical book presents and examines the environmental and health risk assessment calculations as they apply to various chemical process industries. Chemical Process Industries: Environmental Health Risk Calculations can be used as a college text designed to provide new engineers and scientists some comprehension of the industries into which they may enter. It also serves as a useful reference for practitioners which will help them better understand the health risk aspects of various industrial operations. The chemical process industries employ mechanical, electrical, and civil engineers and a host of other scientists; these professions should also benefit from material in this book that applies to their fields of work\"--",
