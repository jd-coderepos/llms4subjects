                "This excellent text recognises that efforts towards improving development outcomes must work in concert with strategies which promote planetary health and support the transition to a sustainable and climate-resilient future. \u2014 Rt Hon Helen Clark, Patron, The Helen Clark Foundation, Auckland, New Zealand. The threat multiplier of climate change is carefully used to examine best practice in a series of excellent case studies exploring the three related responses of disaster risk reduction, sustainable development and climate change adaptation. \u2014Emeritus Professor John Sweeney, Irish Climate Analysis and Research UnitS (ICARUS), Maynooth University, Ireland This book provides concrete examples, through case studies from Ireland and around the world, to help illustrate what it means to think and act simultaneously on development, disasters and climate. \u2014 Dr. Lisa Schipper, Environmental Social Science Research Fellow, Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, United Kingdom. This edited volume critically examines the coherence building opportunity between Climate Change Adaptation, the Sustainable Development Goals and Disaster Risk Reduction agendas. The authors consider opportunities to address the global challenge of developing resilience, as an integrated development continuum instead of through independent and siloed agendas. Stephen Flood is an environmental social science researcher working on various aspects of climate change adaptation, sustainability and resilience. He is based at the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (ICARUS), Maynooth University. Yairen Jerez Columbi\u00e9 investigates cultural exchange, postcolonial ecologies and the sociohistorical and cultural dimensions of environmental challenges. She is an Assistant Professor in Latin American Studies and Intercultural Communication at Trinity College Dublin. Martin Le Tissier is the lead PI for the Identifying Interactions for SDG Implementation in Ireland and Achieving Resilience in the Marine and Coastal Environment of Ireland EPA funded projects based at MaREI. Barry O\u2019Dwyer is lead researcher in the area of impacts and adaptation at MaREI and is leading the development and delivery of Climate Ireland, Ireland\u2019s national resource of climate change and adaptation information."
