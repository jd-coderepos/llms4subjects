                "\"Two of the major parallel challenges facing businesses today are how to adapt to the changes of fast-paced, fragmenting markets and how to grow a business whilst engaging in recognisably sustainable practices. It is not enough to just be sustainable, it is about communicating it and getting the customer involved in the message. Customer-Centric Marketing shows readers how sustainable development practices and digital marketing techniques work naturally together to add value, leading to improved customer satisfaction, better professional relationships and increased effectiveness. Ideal for senior marketing professionals and students on digital marketing or marketing strategy modules who wish to utilise the benefits of sustainable development and forms of digital marketing, this accessible and straight to-the-point book uses case studies to show how the marketing theories and tools work in actual business scenarios. Customer-Centric Marketing covers contemporary issues such as the increasing use of mobile, QR codes and social network sites for consumers interested in ethical, environmental and sustainable marketing\"--",

As more businesses follow suit and update to more sustainable operations, marketing professionals need to learn to communicate the company's values and practices to get consumers engaged in the company's message.Customer-Centric Marketing looks at how to become a socially responsible company whose customers want to advocate for them.  Since customers are more technically-savvy than ever before, this book focuses on creating and implementing a purpose-driven digital marketing plan that sets out: what a company's values and goals are; what a company is good at; what the customers want; how communications can be used to improve internal and external relationships; what role digital communications will play.Offering an actionable plan for adopting sustainable marketing, this book explains how to meet customer expectations, improve an organization's competitive advantage, and grow a business using sustainable and responsible practices\"--"
