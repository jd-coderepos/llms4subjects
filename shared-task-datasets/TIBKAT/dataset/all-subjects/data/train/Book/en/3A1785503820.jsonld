                "\"Environment is a very magnanimous component of ecosystem of \"Blue planet - the earth\", encompassing hydrosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere. All these three spheres have biotic and abiotic components which exhibit ecological homeostasis that provides most appropriate survival chances for the members of biotic component and geochemical balance with abiotic components. This ecosystem is subjected to relatively very harsh conditions mostly created by the disastrous activities due to natural calamities and intentional and/or accidental anthropogenic activities. Biotechnology has become a potential tool to dissipate such environmental impacts because of the advancement it has undergone recently. Emerging Trends in Environmental Biotechnology is an outstanding collection of current research that integrates basic and advanced concepts of biotechnology such as genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, sequencing, and imaging processes to improvise and protect the environment. The book is particularly attractive for scientists, researchers, students, educators and professionals in environmental science, agriculture, veterinary and biotechnology science. This book will enable them to solve the problems about sustainable development with the help of current innovative biotechnologies such as recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering which have tremendous potential for impacting global food security, environmental health, human and animal health and overall livelihood of mankind. Features: Presents easy-to-read chapters; Information is presented in a very accessible and logical format; Identifies and explores biotechnological approaches for environmental protection; Encompasses biodegradation of hazardous contaminants, biotechnology in waste management, nanotechnology, and issues in environmental biotechnology research\"--",
