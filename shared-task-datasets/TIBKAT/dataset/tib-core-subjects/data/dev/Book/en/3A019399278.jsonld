            "abstract": "Concerned with various aspects of language in mathematics education, this book aims to reveal some of the ambiguities and complexities in the way language is used in the mathematics curriculum. It aims to present current perspectives and review key issues in mathematics education.Knowledge is transmitted, explored and advanced via language face-to-face, in printed texts, and in other media. Children and their teachers write, read, talk and listen mathematics. Mathematics education begins and proceeds in language, it advances or stumbles because of language, and its outcomes are often assessed in language. \"Language and Mathematical Educuation\" presents current perspectives and reviews the key issues. It brings together in one volume work from researchers concerned with various aspects of language in mathematics education. Each contributor provides an account of their research and draws out the practical implications in terms which will inform and guide teachers. Following the introductory section there are sections exploring: language and early experiences of number; language and meanings in mathematics education; word problems; the uses of discussion; language, mathematics and disability; and cross-linguistic issues. This book examines how language plays significant and problematic roles in mathematics education, reveals some of the ambiguities and complexities in the way language is used in the mathematics curriculum; and will be a useful resource for all mathematics educators.",
