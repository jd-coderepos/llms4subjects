            "abstract": "\"This book discusses the basic principles of sustainable development in a smart city ecosystem to better serve the life of citizens. It examines smart city systems driven by emerging IoT-powered technologies and the other dependent platforms. AI, IoT Technologies, Big Data Solutions, Cloud Platforms, and Cybersecurity Techniques in Developing Smart Cities, discusses the design and implementation of the core components of the Smart City ecosystem. The editors discuss the effective management and development of smart city infrastructures, starting with planning and integrating complex models and diverse frameworks into an ecosystem. Specifically the chapters examines the core infrastructure elements including activities of the public and private services as well as innovative ICT solutions, Computer Vision, IoT technologies, Data tools, Cloud services, AR/VR technologies, Cybersecurity techniques, Treatment solution of the environmental water pollution, and other intelligent devices for supporting sustainable living in the smart environment. The chapters also discuss machine vision models and implementation as well as real-time robotic applications. Upon reading the book users will be able handle the challenges and improvements of security for smart systems, and will have the know-how to analysis and visualize data using big data tools and visualization applications. The book will provide the technologies, solutions as well as designs about the application design of the smart cities with advanced tools and techniques to students, researchers, engineers and academics\"--",
