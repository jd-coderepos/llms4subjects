            "abstract": "\"Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) devastate many crop plants, causing billions of dollars in agricultural losses each year. Effective management methods to combat plant-parasitic nematodes are synthetic nematicides, but most are non-specific, notoriously toxic and threaten the soil ecosystem, groundwater and human health. The plant by-products, such as oilseed cakes, are sources of bioactive compounds with nematicidal potential. Oilseed cakes are an excellent organic fertilizer, and their bioactive compounds are now gaining importance as they are safe for the environment. This book provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date review of research on the use of oilseed cakes against PPN. The complete knowledge of better use of oilseed cakes for nematode management is necessary for developing effective nematode control options to reduce yield loss. Key features: Plants by-products such as oilseed cakes and their potential applications. Explores bioactive compounds from oilseed cakes for agricultural biofertilization and nematicidal activity. Nematode management in vegetable, fruit and legume crops. Covers the use of oilseed cakes and management of associated challenges This volume is designed and edited to serve as an invaluable resource text for readers associated with plant nematology, plant pathology, plant protection, and agricultural science, including researchers, teachers, advanced undergraduates and graduate students, and even agricultural extension agents and farmers\"--",
