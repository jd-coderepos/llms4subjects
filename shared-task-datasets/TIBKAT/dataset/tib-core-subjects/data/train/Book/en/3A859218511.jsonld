                "\"This book is intended to be an undergraduate text for junior and senior level students majoring in materials science and engineering (MSE). Most MSE undergraduate programs have a one-semester kinetics course in their curricula that has taken the place of a classical physical chemistry course and one or more courses on materials processing. This book is not intended to be a reference work that summarizes and evaluates all of the reactions and phase transformations of importance in materials science and engineering, although some unique topics are presented. Given the breadth of the field today--metals, ceramics, electronic materials, polymers, biomaterials, and composites--it is not feasible to cover all of kinetics. Nevertheless, it does cover considerably more material than can be covered in a one semester course and includes approaches and topics that are rarely found elsewhere that might be useful to graduate students, researchers, and industrial practitioners. One goal of this book is to incorporate important concepts that all students in materials science and engineering should be exposed to at some point in their careers based on the author's personal experience as a student, researcher, practicing engineer, and instructor over a number of years\"--"
